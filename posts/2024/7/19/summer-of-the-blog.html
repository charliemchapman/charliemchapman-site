<p><em><strong>TLDR:</strong> I want to post to my blog at least once a week for the rest of the summer.</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">CGP Grey‚Äôs theme concept</a> over traditional New Year‚Äôs resolutions with more concrete goals. But every once in a while, specific goals have been really effective for me.¬†</p>

<p>Heck, my whole career effectively changed because of a set of New Year‚Äôs goals I made in 2019. To refresh my After Effects skills after a long break from having kids, I set out to <a href="https://x.com/_chuckyc/status/1080137244722282499">make a short animation once a week</a>. I also set a goal release an <a href="https://x.com/_chuckyc/status/1130646235990429696">iOS app to the App Store</a> by the end of that year to bootstrap my Swift knowledge after joining an iOS team at work.</p>

<p>Both goals eventually converged into my animation heavy app <a href="https://darknoise.app/">Dark Noise</a>, and I‚Äôve been a side-hustling indie developer ever since.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m going to try something new this year. After a couple years of neglect, I&#39;m going to try to kick start my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mograph?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mograph</a> skills with a weekly animation project I&#39;m calling <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeeklyMograph?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WeeklyMograph</a><br /><br />My goal is to create one animation every week in 2019. Doesn&#39;t have to be great, just finished <a href="https://t.co/uU54mj7gCm">pic.twitter.com/uU54mj7gCm</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Chapman (@_chuckyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1080137244722282499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I find goals that require a regular cadence of output to be really effective for me. The deadline, even self-imposed, of a once a week animation really forced me into a habit of regularly doing the work.</p>

<p>In the last 4 years I‚Äôve been running my podcast <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">Launched</a> with a self-imposed deadline of delivering an episode every 2 weeks. This really forced me to push off my natural (incredibly strong) procrastination and get things done.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://x.com/_chuckyc/status/1740802949260197998">announcing the semi-hiatus of Launched</a> this year, I haven‚Äôt had that kind of regular motivation to keep pushing myself on growing outside of my normal job. And honestly, I really miss it. I notice myself getting slower and struggling more to be productive even in the day job.</p>

<p>So I want some kind of lightweight recurring goal to kickstart my creative output again. I‚Äôm not ready to commit to the grind of a regular podcast schedule (yet üòè) but there <em>is</em> a particular skill I‚Äôve been wanting to grow lately: <strong>writing</strong>.</p>

<p>Writing is a pretty important part of my <a href="https://x.com/_chuckyc/status/1655594409818312705">job as a Developer Advocate</a>, but I‚Äôve found I really struggle with it. Particularly with speed. I write painfully slowly. I have enough taste to recognize that what I‚Äôm writing is bad, but not enough skill to get it to the point of sounding good. So I just get hung up writing and rewriting sentences trying to get it sounding right before eventually getting distracted with some other task I know I can do. And before I know it, hours have gone by and I‚Äôve barely eked out a few paragraphs.</p>

<h2 id="the-summer-of-the-blog">The Summer of the Blog</h2>

<p>So, I‚Äôm going to make the rest of this season my <strong>Summer of the Blog</strong>. My goal is to post something, anything, to my blog at least once a week. It doesn‚Äôt have to be good, it just has to be shipped. And it can even simply be linking out to something else I‚Äôve made like a podcast episode or a video.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm setting the bar pretty low here because I want it to be easily achievable. The real goal is to get into the habit of regularly publishing, and force myself to put words down with a hard deadline that they have to go out.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm calling it the Summer of the Blog because I want to publicly commit to maintaining this through the end of the summer, which Google tells me ends September 22nd.</p>

<p>After this all bets are off because my children‚Äôs school starts back up and my fall conference travel season kicks back off. I‚Äôd love to keep the pace up after that though, but I‚Äôll have achieved my goal if I make it that far.</p>

<p>What will I write about? I don‚Äôt know yet! I have a lot of blog posts rolling around in my head that I‚Äôve never taken the time to write. The goal here is building up my writing muscles to get over writers block more than building up some kind of audience, so ultimately I‚Äôll write about whatever I‚Äôm passionate about.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs absolutely killing me how long this post already is and I want to spend the next few hours trimming it down and hopelessly flaily to get it sounding better. But I‚Äôm not.</p>
