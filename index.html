    Dark Noise Analytics: March 2023
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">01 Mar 2023</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>I recently added some analytics into <a href="https://darknoise.app/">Dark Noise</a> using the new(ish) privacy-focused analytics tool <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/">TelemetryDeck</a> in preparation for my big update that will be adding a free tier. I want to get an understanding of how many users I might be dealing with going forward and some of my future plans lead me to want to understand what features, and sounds users are using most within the app.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a couple of months now so I have enough data to share some metrics with you all. I think it might be fun to see what changes when I switch to a subscription business model with a free tier. As always, this is meant to be helpful! I don‚Äôt know if these numbers are higher than average, or lower than average. This is just one data point that‚Äôs hopefully helpful to see, especially for other indie developers.</p>

<p>Alright, let‚Äôs start with the high-level stuff.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-overview.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Overview" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs only been a couple of months, but so far <strong>Monthly Active Users</strong> have hovered right around <strong>11,000 to 12,000</strong> unique users. For reference, App Store Connect‚Äôs ‚ÄúActive Last 30 Days‚Äù analytics (which are limited to only users who opt-in) shows 4,300 users.</p>

<p>The <strong>Daily Active Users</strong> is surprisingly consistent at around <strong>2,300 to 2,500</strong> unique users.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-hourly-active.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Hourly Active Users" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Hourly Active Users</strong> very clearly show peaks around nighttime in North America with a smaller peak in the morning confirming my assumption that a large portion of users are probably playing these sounds to go to sleep. The smaller peak in the morning is most likely because most people pause the app in the background or use the timer feature to automatically stop the sound.</p>

<h2 id="device-info">Device Info</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-device-info.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Device Info" /></p>

<p>Looking at device info, about <strong>1/5th</strong> of sessions came from <strong>Macs vs iOS</strong> which I have to admit surprised me to be that high. Good to keep in mind that the Mac does represent a significant portion of my app‚Äôs use.</p>

<p>A little over <strong>90%</strong> of sessions came from the <strong>latest iOS 16 or macOS 13</strong>. This will be interesting to watch as I add a free tier. I think there‚Äôs a chance that a more accessible app will get a higher adoption among the less tech-enthusiast crowd which may actually increase the percentage of users I have on older OSs. Also, hello there iOS 17! üëã</p>

<h2 id="noise-play-counts">Noise Play Counts</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-noise-bar.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Device Info" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-noise-donut.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Noise Count Donut" /></p>

<p>Wow‚Ä¶ Brown Noise is king apparently üòÖ.</p>

<p>I expected some popular sounds and then a long tail, but I definitely didn‚Äôt expect Brown Noise to be that dominant. It‚Äôs cool to see custom mixes are very popular though. I get a lot of positive feedback about that feature, but I always wondered how popular it was to use by most people.</p>

<h1 id="extras">Extras</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-extras.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Extras" /></p>

<p>Here are a couple of extra metrics I found interesting. There‚Äôs not a lot to analyze here other than it‚Äôs nice to have confirmation people really are using these features.</p>

<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm definitely glad I finally added some light analytics back in the app. I think this will be really helpful in guiding decisions on what features or sounds I should focus on going forward. And while TelemetryDeck is still a little young and rough around the edges, I feel confident in that team‚Äôs focus on privacy. And even in the short few months I‚Äôve been using it they‚Äôve dramatically improved the reporting UI.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is helpful for you all! At the very least I think it‚Äôll be an interesting data point to look back on in a few months after my update to subscriptions and having a free tier. As always, if you have any questions or comments I‚Äôd love to hear them on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@charliemchapman">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Twitter</a>.</p>

    2022: A Break, a Breakthrough, and a Breakdown?
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">31 Dec 2022</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>2022 was a bit of a weird year for me that I think kinda breaks down into 3 distinct parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A break</li>
  <li>A breakthrough</li>
  <li>And‚Ä¶ a breakdown?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-break">A Break</h2>

<p>Since switching to iOS development and launching <a href="https://darknoise.app/">Dark Noise</a> in 2019, I‚Äôve been working pretty consistently hard on side project work. I wanted to establish myself in this platform and this community so I could avoid getting pulled back into web development like previously always ended up happening. Dark Noise and my podcast <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">Launched</a> were both mechanisms to keep pushing on both the technical/product side and the community side of things. This was especially important when the pandemic showed up and made connecting with the community much more difficult.</p>

<p>But 2022 was different. I was finally able to travel. We had just bought a new house at the end of 2021. And <em>maybe</em> I was a little burnt out? I‚Äôm not quite sure the full alchemy of reasons, but from the beginning of the year to the end of the summer my side projects really took a back seat.</p>

<p>I did keep producing Launched thanks to a schedule that pulled me along and a lineup of guests I was, quite frankly, extremely proud to have on. But Dark Noise development slowed to a crawl. I spun up a couple <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1504267868241862656">new app ideas</a> that I ran out of steam on and never released.</p>

<p>And it had an impact! Dark Noise sales were down pretty significantly the first half of the year. I had no major releases in that period and being a paid up front app meant that really hurt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022/12/31/dark-noise-yearly-proceeds.jpg" alt="Dark Noise yearly sales graph" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Dark Noise yearly proceeds (released in August 2019)</p>

<p>This might all sound negative but I took advantage of this break and honestly I think I needed it.</p>

<p>I finally got to travel! I finally met coworkers for the first time in San Diego, vacationed with my wife without kids for the first time since the pandemic, went to Europe for the very first time (with the kids!), and <em>finally</em> got to meet folks in the iOS community <strong>in person</strong> at WWDC üò±.</p>

<p class="postCaption">My <a href="https://flighty.app/">Flighty</a> Passport showing all of my 2022 flights</p>

<p>Also in between traveling, Apple reached out asking for a demo version of the Dark Noise Mac app. And now <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1585347257737818113">every Apple retail store in the world has a demo of Dark Noise pre-installed on all of their display Macs</a>! üò±</p>

<h2 id="a-breakthrough">A Breakthrough</h2>

<p>Two things happened at the end of summer that changed my side project trajectory.</p>

<h4 id="dark-noise-returns">Dark Noise Returns</h4>

<p>The first is simply Apple‚Äôs OS release cadence. The nice thing about Apple‚Äôs release cadence is it sort of forces me to get a release pulled together by a certain date. This year, that meant I needed Dark Noise to be ready with iOS 16 support and features like the <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkNoiseApp/status/1569328284923486211">new Lock Screen widgets</a> in September with a follow up release in October to support the <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkNoiseApp/status/1584549536269148162">new Dynamic Island and Live Activities</a>.</p>

<p>This release kind of woke me up from the side project blues and got the gears going again with regards to Dark Noise development. This was partially fueled by extra time I now had because of the <em>other</em> breakthrough I had at the end of summer.</p>

<h4 id="launched-with-help">Launched With Help</h4>

<p>In August I decided I needed some help with Launched. Editing the show was simply taking too much of my limited side project time. I wanted to hire an editor, which meant I needed money. I didn‚Äôt want to take on selling sponsorships myself given I was already stretched too thin so I started putting together a pitch deck to see if I could find a network that would let Launched join.</p>

<p>Looking over the pitch deck stats I basically chickened out thinking the numbers were probably too low for anyone to consider and never even reached out to anyone. Instead I simply <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1561695800656379904">tweeted them out</a> and moved on.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, this ended up paying off! <a href="https://mastodon.social/@refactoredd@mastodon.online">Jonathan Ruiz</a> had recently ended his show, <a href="https://twitter.com/_everydayrobots">Everyday Robots</a>, and reached out to offer to edit the Launched. I took him up on the offer and every episode since has been edited by Jonathan.</p>

<p>I cannot express how big of an impact this has had. I am pretty precious with the edit of that show, but Jonathan has been outstanding. And the time it‚Äôs freed up has allowed me to pour more time into growing both the podcast (I‚Äôm gearing up to start taking on sponsorships) <strong>and</strong> turning Dark Noise into a potentially fully viable business into it‚Äôs own.</p>

<h2 id="a-breakdown">A Breakdown</h2>

<p><em>Note: ok this headline is a pretty hyperbolic for the sake of keeping the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù theme but you have to admit it‚Äôs pretty catchy yeah?</em> üòÖ</p>

<p>The end of 2022 has been‚Ä¶ turbulent to say the least. The tech industry has suddenly gotten a little unstable. And Twitter, the platform that the hosts the community I‚Äôd invested so much in, was imploding. There are also some personal career things I can‚Äôt discuss here that put me, an extremely risk averse personality, into hardcore de-risking mode.</p>

<p>I started putting together action plans. What do I do if I get laid off? How much runway do I have to find another job? Can I grow that runway if my side projects are making more money? Could my side projects <em>be</em> the other job?</p>

<p>This brewed a pretty weird concoction of excitement mixed with anxiety that‚Äôs launching me into 2023 with a pretty clearly defined set of short term goals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Switch Dark Noise to a subscription model.</li>
  <li>Monetize Launched with a combination of sponsorships and membership/Patreon.</li>
  <li>Invest in the local (St. Louis) iOS community by starting some kind of meetup.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like my goals have usually been more high-minded and <em>‚Äúpersonal growth‚Äù</em> focused in years past. It feels a little crass for a major theme to essentially be <em>‚Äúmake more money‚Äù</em> but this is where I am. We‚Äôll see where 2023 takes me, but either way I‚Äôm at least coming into it with a side-eye towards handling uncertainty.</p>

    iOS 15 Support with Dark Noise 2.6
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">05 Oct 2021</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Dark Noise 2.6 comes to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">App Store today</a> with full support for iOS 15!</p>

<h2 id="extra-large-widgets">Extra Large Widgets</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/10/05/dark-noise-2_6-extra-large-widgets.jpg" alt="New Extra Large Widgets" /></p>

<p>iOS 15 introduced a new widget size exclusive to iPad and Dark Noise 2.6 adds support for these new big sizes. Now you can fill your iPad with 16 wide button noises, or a whopping 32 square button noises in a single widget!</p>

<p>And of course these widgets support all of the themes and customizations you‚Äôve come to expect from Dark Noise widgets.</p>

<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/10/05/dark-noise-2_6-shortcuts.jpg" alt="New Shortcuts Actions" /></p>

<p>Due to limitations in iOS 14, Shortcuts actions with parameters could not play audio without opening the app up in the foreground. This led to a confusing array of Shortcuts actions provided by Dark Noise. Shortcuts actions <strong>with parameters</strong> for setting up a timer or volume (began with the word ‚ÄúStart‚Äù) had to open the app in the foreground to start a sound, and shortcuts with <strong>no parameters</strong> (began with the word ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù) were limited but could play sounds in the background.</p>

<p>With iOS 15 things are dramatically simpler. New ‚ÄúPlay [Noise]‚Äù Shortcuts actions can play noises in the background <strong>and</strong> have parameter options for customizations.</p>

<p>There is also a new Shortcut action called ‚ÄúFind [Noise]‚Äù for advanced Shortcuts users. This action accepts a string parameter, searches Dark Noise for a matching noise, and outputs a Noise object that the new ‚ÄúPlay [Noise]‚Äù action will accept as an input.</p>

<p>This allows for more advanced automations where you want to dynamically pass in a string for which noise you would like to play.  To be honest I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the main use case for this is, but I‚Äôve recieved enough requests for it that I thought it was worth adding. I‚Äôd love to hear from anybody who uses it to see what they‚Äôve built!</p>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-improvements">Bug Fixes and Improvements</h2>

<p>A new timer view using iOS 15‚Äôs new half sheet popover and some minor bug fixes round out the update. This year‚Äôs iOS beta cycle has been‚Ä¶ busy to say the least (I moved into a new house!). Things are finally settling down and I‚Äôm getting back to work on Dark Noises next major feature!</p>

    Overviewer Week 1
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">14 Jan 2021</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/14/overviewer-icon-rounded-200.png" alt="Overviewer app icon" /></p>

<p>Last week, when I released my new app <a href="/posts/2021/1/6/overviewer">Overviewer</a>, I honestly thought it was a pretty niche product and was just hoping it would find the few other teachers out there who it could help during this wild year of virtual learning. With that in mind, I didn‚Äôt really do much in the way of marketing like I <a href="/posts/2019/9/27/marketing-dark-noise">did with Dark Noise</a>. But it turns out, there‚Äôs more interest in turning an iPhone into a document camera than I thought! üòÖ</p>

<p>As is tradition, I‚Äôd like to go through some quick metrics for the app launch and see if there‚Äôs anything. Let‚Äôs start with the basics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>üìà 181,000 ‚ÄúApp Units Sold‚Äù ü§Ø</li>
  <li>üìç 17,170 Sessions <em>(opt-in only metrics)</em></li>
  <li>‚≠êÔ∏è 192 ratings avg 4.8 stars</li>
  <li>üìù 57 reviews</li>
  <li>üí• 0 crashes üòÅ <em>(opt-in only metrics)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, we need to address that ridiculous 181,000 ‚ÄúApp Units Sold‚Äù number because‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kind of unbelievable. When something looks unbelievable there‚Äôs probably a reason.</p>

<p>The first sign something weird was happening was actually immediately after launch when the app supposedly got <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1346899004878106629?s=20">32,000 downloads in the first hour</a>. And while ‚Äúsessions‚Äù metrics are only available to users who have opted in to allow developers to see their analytics, 17,170 seems way lower than what you would expect if there were truly 181,000 users.</p>

<p>It turns out, school districts have access to something called the <a href="https://vpp.itunes.apple.com/?l=en">Volume Purchasing Program</a> (VPP) that allows them to purchase apps for distribution to all Apple devices in their districts. When an app is free, admins can ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/timgostony/status/1347290649049980928?s=20">as many licenses as they want</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sohojoester/status/1347280847959834625?s=20">some folks on Twitter</a> said they would <em>‚Äúgenerally buy at least 3x the number of devices I could possible deploy to and then deploy as needed‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>So most likely these huge numbers of ‚Äúpurchases‚Äù are school admins grabbing way more licenses than they‚Äôll actually use just to cover their bases. If we break down unit sales by ‚Äúdevice‚Äù I think we can see this in the data.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/14/overviewer-7-day-unit-sales-devices.jpg" alt="7 Day Unit Sales by Device" /></p>

<p>Here you can see about 157,000 units were purchased on ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù while about 24,000 were from iOS devices (and 5 on iPod touch üòÜ). Overviewer isn‚Äôt available on the Mac, so I think it‚Äôs safe to say those 157,000 are actually from volume licensing and only a small fraction of those ever end up downloaded to a device. But the 24,000 from iOS devices are probably mostly legitimate downloads.</p>

<h3 id="press">Press</h3>

<p>These numbers are <em>way</em> higher than I was expecting! So what happened? Unlike with Dark Noise, I didn‚Äôt try to build up a big TestFlight group or reach out to the press beforehand, but I did make a simple <a href="https://overviewer.app">presskit</a> and wrote up a <a href="/posts/2021/1/6/overviewer">blog post</a> with the story behind the app.</p>

<p>Pretty quickly after releasing my blog post, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/06/iphone-document-camera-overviewer-zoom/">9to5Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.imore.com/overviewer-turns-your-iphone-document-camera-zoom-calls">iMore</a>, and <a href="https://knapsack.news/overviewer-for-ios-turns-your-phone-into-a-document-camera/">Knapsack</a> all wrote up articles about the app. This led to a lot of follow-on articles from loads of smaller blogs around the world. Then later in the day, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217200/overviewer-app-teachers-overhead-camera-iphone-zoom">The Verge</a> wrote about the app! ü§Ø I‚Äôm going to be honest here, seeing that pop up in my feed almost broke me. I was literally shaking.</p>

<p>I have 2 theories for how I got all this press.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I‚Äôve already built a little reputation with Dark Noise and some relationships that put me on some tech writers‚Äô radar right out of the gate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told a compelling, relatable story that fit a broader narrative for the world we all live in right now.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you don‚Äôt already have a reputation or relationships with anybody in the press, there‚Äôs not a lot you can do for the first point. I would say making a decent press kit and cold emailing writers is probably the best you can do here.</p>

<p>Point 2 wasn‚Äôt exactly something I did on purpose, but it was pretty clear as more articles came in that the story - <em>‚ÄúNerdy Dev Makes App to Help Teacher Wife with Virtual Learning‚Äù</em> - was the thing a lot of folks were keying in to. It fits neatly into the narrative we‚Äôre all currently living through, where we‚Äôre trying to come up with interesting solutions to our pandemic world.</p>

<p>I think telling a compelling, relatable story when announcing your app can go a long way to help you get the word out there.</p>

<p>I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fadOMMpQErg">tutorial video</a> to try to help explain how the app works, and I think this may have inadvertently added to the personalized story behind the app since I‚Äôm the one personally showing the app off on camera.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/14/overviewer-7-day-sources-metrics.jpg" alt="Overviewer Sources Metrics" /></p>

<p>Here are the sources metrics from App Store Connect. As expected The Verge and 9to5 did a lot of the heavy lifting on the Web Referrer side, but the size of Facebook in the App Referrers initially surprised me. I searched around and found that a lot of people (usually teachers) were sharing The Verge article on Facebook. Presumably, since the Facebook app has a built in browser, any links from The Verge to the App Store would actually be counted as coming from the Facebook app.</p>

<h3 id="thanks-">Thanks üôè</h3>

<p>I guess I‚Äôll wrap up by saying thanks to everyone who shared the app with any teachers or educators they know who might find it useful. Seeing that this little app I made is <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1348985834897367040?s=20">being used in the real world</a> and helping teachers and kids learn during this wild year is extraordinarily fulfilling. I‚Äôve also heard from some people using Overviewer for tabletop gaming with friends over Zoom which is totally awesome and not something I had considered at all.</p>

<p>If you haven‚Äôt yet can download the app for free on the App Store <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1528900395">here</a>. And as always, if you have any suggestions for how to improve the app, or if you find another alternate use for it outside of virtual learning, let me know!</p>
