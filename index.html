    On Vision Pro
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">07 Dec 2023</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p><em>Note: This post was hastily written on my iPhone while traveling so please forgive the typos.</em></p>

<p>As I write this, I‚Äôm sitting at an airport, on my way to New York to attend a developer lab with Apple to try out Dark Noise on Vision Pro. This time tomorrow I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to really share my thoughts on the product until after its release ‚Äúearly next year‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>And boy‚Ä¶ do I have thoughts.</strong></p>

<p>So I want to write them all down. Not as some smart tech insider who understands the ecosystem and can predict how this new product category will succeed or fail in the market. But more as a time capsule to capture the thoughts of a random iOS developer at this point in time. This will probably be an overly long and unorganized rambling‚Ä¶ so you‚Äôve been warned.</p>

<p>To cut to the chase‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand this product. Not just this expensive V1 pseudo-devkit they‚Äôre releasing next year. But also the whole future version of this overall product category, even after a bunch of incremental improvements.</p>

<p>Before I explain myself, I want to be clear. I am extremely excited about it all. It looks incredible from a technical and design perspective. It genuinely feels deeply thought through from the privacy angle, overal experience, and of course the classic Apple fit and finish. From what‚Äôs been shared publicly so far, everyone who‚Äôs worked on it should be extremely proud. Heck, I‚Äôm flying to New York just to spend a day trying it out and trying to understand how my app fits on this new platform.</p>

<p><strong>But I don‚Äôt understand it as a mass market product.</strong></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with what <em>does</em> makes sense to me.</p>

<h2 id="home-theater">Home Theater</h2>

<p>Vision Pro looks incredible for watching movies. As long as you‚Äôre doing it alone anyway. No doubt it‚Äôs going to be hard to beat immersing yourself in a beautiful environment, looking at an enormous screen, and listening to wonderful simulated Dolby Atmos surround sound while sitting on your couch.</p>

<p>Even someone like me, who‚Äôs rarely watching a movie completely alone, will enjoy this for the occasional show I watch on my own on my iPad while my wife sits next to me in the living room watching something else. The pass through feature means I won‚Äôt feel totally isolated since I can still easily see her and can presumably pause and easily talk to her at any point (as long as the weird outward facing eyes on the headset don‚Äôt freak her out too much üòÖ).</p>

<p>And if the experience is actually good while on a plane? That would be amazing! Assuming it‚Äôs culturally acceptable and I wouldn‚Äôt feel like a total weirdo putting a big screen on my face.</p>

<p>But a $3,500 super nice personal home theater isn‚Äôt a mass market product. And that brings us to gaming.</p>

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>

<p>Sitting here in 2023, gaming is the obvious area of focus for a VR headset. So far, it‚Äôs the only place where VR has really found any product market fit, with Meta and Valve leading the charge.</p>

<p>Apple doesn‚Äôt seem to be addressing this market‚Ä¶ at all? The gaming segment of the Vision Pro announcement video simply showed that you could pair a normal Playstation controller and play flat 2D Apple Arcade games on a big screen floating in front of you.</p>

<p>This feels completely bizarre to me. The iPhone has been a massive success in gaming, so I figured they would, at the very least, support some kind of 3rd Party VR hand controllers and allow VR games made for the Quest and Vive to be ported over to Vision Pro? It seems like it‚Äôd be the best non-tethered VR gaming system by a decent margin.</p>

<p>But to be fair, VR gaming hasn‚Äôt exactly been a game-changing platform. People buy them, and enjoy them. But they‚Äôre tiny platforms compared to traditional TV consoles like the Playstation, Xbox, and Switch.</p>

<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>

<p>A frequently cited use case for VR as a platform is better meetings. A lot of digital ink has been spilled about how much more ‚Äúpresence‚Äù or ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù VR can provide when on a virtual meeting compared to a traditional conference call platform like Zoom or FaceTime.</p>

<p>This has never really made any sense to me. Maybe I‚Äôm being a luddite here, but even the most advanced version of a future VR based meeting experience I can imagine will still be worse than a mediocre web cam based video call. There‚Äôs sooooo much information being conveyed by simply seeing an actual representation of a person at that point in time (in the context of their space at that point in time).</p>

<p>‚ÄúOoh did you get a haircut, looks great!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou look really tired, you doing ok?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhoa it‚Äôs dark there, is it storming there?‚Äù</p>

<p>These types of interactions happen constantly for me and help build a relationship and further trust with my team/family/friends. Losing that information resolution would require some kind of major gain from the technology. And a ‚Äúfeeling of presence‚Äù is difficult for me to imagine overcoming those drawbacks. But I‚Äôve also never tired it myself, so maybe I‚Äôll be surprised.</p>

<p>I do think there is a story around the ‚Äúpresence‚Äù thing where VR could enable a group meeting experience where multiple people could be in the same room and sustain multiple, separate concurrent conversations, which traditional video conferencing doesn‚Äôt really allow for currently. But that‚Äôs definitely not what I‚Äôve seen from anybody so far.</p>

<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>

<p>This is the one area where I can see a sliver of a compelling story for the future of VisionOS as a larger platform than just a personal home theater.</p>

<p>I can imagine a world where I sit at my home office, usually alone, and instead of staring at a desk full of monitors, I put on a headset and have an infinite canvas of big windows and maybe even some 3d elements all around me.</p>

<p>This is an experience the V1 Vision Pro can somewhat provide. Though the limited power means it couldn‚Äôt replace my Mac, and the current iteration of Mac mirroring limits you to a single 4K window. But I can project out a future of incremental improvements that get there. Maybe I could plug my battery pack directly into a beefier Mac for all of my heavier loads like Video Editing. And I‚Äôd probably still use a keyboard and trackpad. But that sounds like a nice experience and a much less cluttered desk.</p>

<p>But, importantly, this still wouldn‚Äôt replace my laptop. I‚Äôm not going to use this when my wife and I are planning a vacation, where we both are constantly showing each other our screens. Or take it to a coffee shop. Or take meeting notes in a customer meeting.</p>

<p>But as a solo use only desktop enhancement (or even replacement if your workload isn‚Äôt super heavy), yeah sure this would be a great experience. But how big is that market? And the price would have to drop way lower if that‚Äôs the only story right?</p>

<h2 id="full-ar-glasses">Full AR Glasses</h2>

<p><em>‚ÄúBut wait!‚Äù</em> I hear you say. <em>‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about a VR headset, this is just the stepping stone to the eventual AR Glasses!‚Äù</em></p>

<p>This is a framing of this product that‚Äôs been around forever, but I don‚Äôt think that product is even on a 10 year time horizon from now. I‚Äôm not even sure we‚Äôll ever see that product.</p>

<p>As far as I‚Äôm aware, there doesn‚Äôt exist a display technology that‚Äôs transparent, with the the ability to fully obscure your view (to render blacks), contains a backlight (to render whites), and can move the focus distance feet away from your eyes. I can imagine a version of this current product that‚Äôs been miniaturized down enough to look like some old-time motorcycle goggles or something, but I find it difficult to believe AR glasses, the way many people have described them, are remotely in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>

<p>I don‚Äôt know! Maybe this is exactly how people have felt about other revolutionary devices. I think, at the very least, Apple and others pursuing VR/AR are at least inventing a lot of cool technology that will make sense in other types of products with clear product market fit. It sure feels like the Spatial Audio features of AirPods may have come out of some of the work for VisionOS. Maybe it‚Äôll be like Google Wave. A product not long for this world, but some innovations that live on to power other products.</p>

<p>Either way I‚Äôm truly excited to see how it all plays out.</p>

    Launched Diary: Dark Noise 3.0

<p class="post-meta">12 Apr 2023</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Inspired by David Smith‚Äôs wonderful <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/110">Launch Diary episode of Under the Radar</a> I tried something a little fun last week and recorded an <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/launched-diary-3-81409064">audio diary</a> of my experience launching the big <a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2023/4/2/dark-noise-3">Dark Noise 3.0 update</a>.</p>

<p>My original thought was that it would be a member-only episode for the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/launched">Launched Patreon</a>, but after listening I decided I wanted it to be a little more accessible than that. The episode is available to listen to for free and Launched members will see it automatically appear in their podcast player if they‚Äôre subscribed to their member Launched Pro feed.</p>

<p>Hopefully you find this helpful, or at least interesting! If folks like this type of thing I‚Äôd like to do more things like this for patrons in the future. If you have any ideas I‚Äôd love to hear them.</p>

    Dark Noise 3.0: White noise, freed
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">02 Apr 2023</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Today <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise 3.0</a> is <em>finally</em> released on the App Store.</p>

<p>The biggest change in Dark Noise 3.0 is the introduction of a new free tier. This free tier includes access to 8 free sounds, as well as full support for infinitely looping sounds, Shortcuts, Siri integration, the Timer, and all the deep Apple integrations you‚Äôve come to expect from Dark Noise. This makes the app more accessible than it‚Äôs ever been before!</p>

<p>For those who want more features and sounds, there is <strong>Dark Noise Pro</strong>. This optional subscription or lifetime in-app purchase unlocks over 50 sounds, the ability to create custom mixes, alternate app icons, and alternate premium themes. With Dark Noise Pro, you can customize your white noise experience to your liking.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/04/02/dark-noise-pro-compare.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Tier Comparisons" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been working on this update for quite a while, and a significant portion of that time was spent ensuring existing customers are taken care of. Customers who purchased Dark Noise before this update are called <strong>Dark Originals</strong>. At launch, they will have all Dark Noise Pro features unlocked automatically. There <em>may</em> be features introduced in the future that require a Dark Noise Pro subscription, but for now Dark Originals will receive all of the same features as Dark Noise Pro.</p>

<p>Dark Noise 3.0 also begins the process of improving the experience of Dark Noise with headphones or nicer speakers. This update includes <strong>4 high quality stereo remasters</strong> of existing sounds: Rain, Thunderstorm, Beach, and Airplane Interior. Future updates will include more remasters as well as a new focus on increasing the variety of sounds in Dark Noise.</p>

<p>As always, this update includes a plethora of small enhancements and bug fixes including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Newly updated App Icon</li>
  <li>Rewritten theme picker</li>
  <li>New Aurora premium theme</li>
  <li>New Aurora alternate app icon</li>
  <li>Mac window size restores from previous session</li>
</ul>

<p>Dark Noise 3.0 is available <strong>now</strong> on the App Store to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">download for free</a>! I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you all think. If you‚Äôre press you can find an extensive <a href="https://darknoise.app/press">press-kit</a> and <a href="https://darknoise.app/posts/dark-noise-3">more details</a> on the release on <a href="https://darknoise.app/">darknoise.app</a>.</p>

    Dark Noise Analytics: March 2023
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">01 Mar 2023</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>I recently added some analytics into <a href="https://darknoise.app/">Dark Noise</a> using the new(ish) privacy-focused analytics tool <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/">TelemetryDeck</a> in preparation for my big update that will be adding a free tier. I want to get an understanding of how many users I might be dealing with going forward and some of my future plans lead me to want to understand what features, and sounds users are using most within the app.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a couple of months now so I have enough data to share some metrics with you all. I think it might be fun to see what changes when I switch to a subscription business model with a free tier. As always, this is meant to be helpful! I don‚Äôt know if these numbers are higher than average, or lower than average. This is just one data point that‚Äôs hopefully helpful to see, especially for other indie developers.</p>

<p>Alright, let‚Äôs start with the high-level stuff.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-overview.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Overview" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs only been a couple of months, but so far <strong>Monthly Active Users</strong> have hovered right around <strong>11,000 to 12,000</strong> unique users. For reference, App Store Connect‚Äôs ‚ÄúActive Last 30 Days‚Äù analytics (which are limited to only users who opt-in) shows 4,300 users.</p>

<p>The <strong>Daily Active Users</strong> is surprisingly consistent at around <strong>2,300 to 2,500</strong> unique users.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-hourly-active.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Hourly Active Users" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Hourly Active Users</strong> very clearly show peaks around nighttime in North America with a smaller peak in the morning confirming my assumption that a large portion of users are probably playing these sounds to go to sleep. The smaller peak in the morning is most likely because most people pause the app in the background or use the timer feature to automatically stop the sound.</p>

<h2 id="device-info">Device Info</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-device-info.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Device Info" /></p>

<p>Looking at device info, about <strong>1/5th</strong> of sessions came from <strong>Macs vs iOS</strong> which I have to admit surprised me to be that high. Good to keep in mind that the Mac does represent a significant portion of my app‚Äôs use.</p>

<p>A little over <strong>90%</strong> of sessions came from the <strong>latest iOS 16 or macOS 13</strong>. This will be interesting to watch as I add a free tier. I think there‚Äôs a chance that a more accessible app will get a higher adoption among the less tech-enthusiast crowd which may actually increase the percentage of users I have on older OSs. Also, hello there iOS 17! üëã</p>

<h2 id="noise-play-counts">Noise Play Counts</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-noise-bar.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Device Info" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-noise-donut.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Noise Count Donut" /></p>

<p>Wow‚Ä¶ Brown Noise is king apparently üòÖ.</p>

<p>I expected some popular sounds and then a long tail, but I definitely didn‚Äôt expect Brown Noise to be that dominant. It‚Äôs cool to see custom mixes are very popular though. I get a lot of positive feedback about that feature, but I always wondered how popular it was to use by most people.</p>

<h1 id="extras">Extras</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/03/01/dark-noise-stats-2023-extras.jpg" alt="Dark Noise 2023 Stats Extras" /></p>

<p>Here are a couple of extra metrics I found interesting. There‚Äôs not a lot to analyze here other than it‚Äôs nice to have confirmation people really are using these features.</p>

<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm definitely glad I finally added some light analytics back in the app. I think this will be really helpful in guiding decisions on what features or sounds I should focus on going forward. And while TelemetryDeck is still a little young and rough around the edges, I feel confident in that team‚Äôs focus on privacy. And even in the short few months I‚Äôve been using it they‚Äôve dramatically improved the reporting UI.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is helpful for you all! At the very least I think it‚Äôll be an interesting data point to look back on in a few months after my update to subscriptions and having a free tier. As always, if you have any questions or comments I‚Äôd love to hear them on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@charliemchapman">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Twitter</a>.</p>
