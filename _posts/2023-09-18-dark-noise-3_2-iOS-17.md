Today I've released [Dark Noise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395) 3.2 with support for iOS 17 and the all new interactive widgets.

Dark Noise widgets have been rebuilt from the ground up to support the all new interactive widgets in iOS 17. This means you can start and stop a sound right from your widget without needing to open the app.

There are now 8 different widget's to choose from, each with 12 themes you can configure between. The small widgets all work wonderfully with iOS 17's new StandBy mode, making it easier than ever to start your favorite ambient noise when you go to sleep.
