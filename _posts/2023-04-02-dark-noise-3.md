Today [Dark Noise 3.0](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395) is _finally_ released on the App Store.

The biggest change in Dark Noise 3.0 is the introduction of a new free tier. This free tier includes access to 8 free sounds, as well as full support for infinitely looping sounds, Shortcuts, Siri integration, the Timer, and all the deep Apple integrations you've come to expect from Dark Noise. This makes the app more accessible than it's ever been before!

For those who want more features and sounds, there is **Dark Noise Pro**. This optional subscription or lifetime in-app purchase unlocks over 50 sounds, the ability to create custom mixes, alternate app icons, and alternate premium themes. With Dark Noise Pro, you can customize your white noise experience to your liking.

I've been working on this update for quite a while, and a significant portion of that time was spent ensuring existing customers are taken care of. Customers who purchased Dark Noise before this update are called **Dark Originals**. At launch, they will have all Dark Noise Pro features unlocked automatically. There _may_ be features introduced in the future that require a Dark Noise Pro subscription, but for now Dark Originals will receive all of the same features as Dark Noise Pro.

Dark Noise 3.0 also begins the process of improving the experience of Dark Noise with headphones or nicer speakers. This update includes **4 high quality stereo remasters** of existing sounds: Rain, Thunderstorm, Beach, and Airplane Interior. Future updates will include more remasters as well as a new focus on increasing the variety of sounds in Dark Noise.

As always, this update includes a plethora of small enhancements and bug fixes including:
* Newly updated App Icon
* Rewritten theme picker
* New Aurora premium theme
* New Aurora alternate app icon
* Mac window size restores from previous session

Dark Noise 3.0 is available **now** on the App Store to [download for free](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395)! I can't wait to hear what you all think.
