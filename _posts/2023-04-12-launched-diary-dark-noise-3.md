Inspired by David Smith's wonderful [Launch Diary episode of Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar/110) I tried something a little fun last week and recorded an [audio diary](https://www.patreon.com/posts/launched-diary-3-81409064) of my experience launching the big [Dark Noise 3.0 update](https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2023/4/2/dark-noise-3). 

My original thought was that it would be a member-only episode for the [Launched Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/launched), but after listening I decided I wanted it to be a little more accessible than that. The episode is available to listen to for free and Launched members will see it automatically appear in their podcast player if they're subscribed to their member Launched Pro feed.

Hopefully you find this helpful, or at least interesting! If folks like this type of thing I'd like to do more things like this for patrons in the future. If you have any ideas I'd love to hear them.

You can listen to the episode (and become a member if you want to support the show ðŸ˜‰) on the [Launched Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/launched-diary-3-81409064).
