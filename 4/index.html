    Launched Week 1 Stats
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">21 Jan 2020</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Last week I launched my new podcast <a href="/posts/2020/1/13/introducing-launched">Launched</a> and I wanted to share a little bit about how I went about creating the show similar to what I did with my posts about <a href="/posts/2019/9/2/designing-dark-noise">designing</a> and <a href="/posts/2019/9/27/marketing-dark-noise">marketing</a> my app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a>.</p>

<p>But before I write that up I want to share some stats about how week 1 went. I’m very happy with how it’s been received so far, but honestly I don’t know the podcast world enough to tell you if these numbers are <em>good</em> or not (though they are significantly better than <em>my</em> previous podcasting efforts 😅).</p>

<p>As I’ll explain in a later post, I released 1 episode a day all week, so there are 5 episodes included in these stats. Here’s the quick rundown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>⬇️ 5,727 total downloads</li>
  <li>⬇️ 1,047 average downloads per episode</li>
  <li>📖 13 Reviews</li>
  <li>⭐️ 22 Ratings</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3>

<p>Because it’s an interview show, there is expectedly quite a bit of variance betwen episodes. I don’t think it’s fair to guests to share stats attached to their names, so I’m not labeling which episode is which.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/21/launched-episode-downloads.jpg" alt="Week 1 Top Episode Downloads" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Total downloads per episode after week 1 (in order of downloads)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/21/launched-episode-lifespan.jpg" alt="Episode Lifespan" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Downloads per day per episode</p>

<p>It’s really hard to make to many assertions based on this data so far.  There’s a lot of variables from the guest down to the day of week the episode went live.</p>

<h3 id="demographics">Demographics</h3>

<p>Let’s look at some demographics.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/21/launched-user-agents.jpg" alt="User Agents" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Apps used to download episodes. Spotify not listed here but only has 119 "starts" which sets it between Breaker &amp; Firefox</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/21/launched-locations.jpg" alt="Locations" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Where episodes were downloaded from.</p>

<p>Two things stand out here. Overcast is dramatically over represented compared to my understanding of the industry average. This makes sense given the more tech (and Apple specifically) target audience, but that’s still pretty striking. It makes me happy that a large portion of the audience is using a player that supports the chapters and custom artwork that I put a decent amount of work into. 😊</p>

<p>I’m also pretty pleased that the rest of the world just edged over 50% vs the United States. It really makes me goofy smile to know that there are people all over the world listening to something that I’m making.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>

<p>The only other metrics that may be interesting are the social network numbers. The podcast’s <a href="https://twitter.com/launchedfm">Twitter account</a> has 395 followers which I’m pretty happy about. And the subbreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaunchedFM/">r/LaunchedFM</a> has 63 members which… isn’t much in Reddit terms. I’ll talk about this more on an upcoming post, but I’m not sure Reddit makes as much sense for a show of this size as I was originally thinking it would.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about any other metrics please don’t hesitate to ask me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Twitter</a>. I like to be as much of an open book as I can on this stuff.</p>

<p>And hopefully I’ll get a post up <em>relatively</em> soon walking through the development and marketing process of Launched!</p>

<p>Today I’m really excited to be releasing the first episode of my new podcast <a href="https://launchedfm.com">Launched</a>.  Here’s the pitch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched is a fortnightly show where I interview app developers and other creators about their experiences releasing their creation out into the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year while I was working towards the release of <a href="/posts/2019/8/27/dark-noise">Dark Noise</a> I found that listening to developer interviews on podcasts was extremely helpful in preparing me for what to expect and giving me ideas on how to build a marketing plan around the release.  My hope is that Launched can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.</p>

<p>I’m pretty excited to see where this goes! Rest assured I’ll be posting updates with stats and I’ll try to do a post outlining everything I’ve done to try to market the show similar to what I did with the <a href="/posts/2019/9/27/marketing-dark-noise">Marketing Dark Noise</a> post.</p>

<p>If this sounds interesting you can find links to <a href="https://launchedfm.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a>. And if you enjoy it <strong>please</strong> consider giving me a rating or review in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/launched/id1491582246">Apple Podcasts</a></p>

<p>You can also follow the show on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/launchedfm">@LaunchedFM</a> and check out the dedicated Subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaunchedFM/">/r/LaunchedFM</a> to talk with other listeners about the show.</p>

<p>And if you’re a creator who’s recently (or soon to be) launched something and would like to tell your story, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxduoOnjnF_qE6PpnEGdKewWHvB3YDl0gv3WAxAJ4HDVq8Bg/viewform">apply here</a> to potentially come on the show.</p>

  <a href="/posts/2019/10/16/dark-noise-1-2">
    Dark Noise 1.2
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">16 Oct 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Today I’m releasing the first update to Dark Noise bringing new iOS 13 features and adding a few new sounds.  With Dark Noise 1.2 I’ve brought 3 main feature improvements:</p>

<h2 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h2>

<p>Dark Noise already has multiple themes, including a pure black mode, but I still wanted to take advantage of the new system-wide dark mode in iOS 13.  In Dark Noise 1.2 you can now select a separate theme to use for the system dark and light modes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/10/16/dark-mode-theme-settings.png" alt="Dark Mode Theme Settings" /></p>

<p>This will allow you to quickly switch to a darker theme by hitting the switch in control center, or automatically switch themes based on the time of day using the new system appearance scheduler.</p>

<h2 id="parameterized-shortcuts">Parameterized Shortcuts</h2>

<p>In iOS 13 Apple added a new feature to Shortcuts that allows users to set parameters for actions provided by apps.  For Dark Noise, this means that you can now create a shortcut action that sets a timer with a user specified time set directly in the shortcuts app.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/10/16/dark-noise-shortcuts-sample.png" alt="Dark Mode Parameterized Shortcuts" /></p>

<p>There’s a few unfortunate caveats that I need to address however.  Shortcuts with parameters cannot run audio without opening up the app first (unless you’re Apple Music 😒) so any of the new shortcuts will not be able to run in the background.</p>

<p>For this reason, I’m also including the old style shortcuts that will allow you to run the audio in the background.  The old style shortcuts all begin with the word “Play” and have a toggle for “Show When Run”.  Unfortunately there is a new bug (feature?) in iOS 13 that only allows me to add 10 of these so you will see the <em>most recently played</em> noises as options in the shortcuts app.</p>

<p>On top of this there is also now a “Play Pause Noise” shortcut that will pause the currently playing noise.  This will work even if the “Mix Audio” setting is turned on which prevents the system level “Play/Pause” action from working.</p>

<h2 id="siri">Siri</h2>

<p>Dark Noise is now integrated with Siri in iOS 13!  This means that without setting anything up ahead of time you can say “Hey Siri, play distant thunder in Dark Noise” and Siri will start the sound.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/10/16/dark-noise-siri.png" alt="Dark Noise Siri" /></p>

<p>In the current version of iOS 13, Siri integration is still a bit rough around the edges.  It frequently gets the noise name wrong and will fail to play.  It’s also not currently working on the HomePod since, as of the time of this writing, the HomePod software still hasn’t updated from iOS 12.  These issues should improve as Apple releases updates throughout the year, but I wanted to make sure I called them out.</p>

<h2 id="new-sounds">New Sounds</h2>

<p>Last but not least, Dark Noise 1.2 has 4 new sounds, each with custom animated icons of course!  This first batch was based on the most highly requested sounds since launch, but I’ve been collecting all of your suggestions and will keep adding more over time so don’t worry if your request isn’t included.</p>

<p>Here’s the new sounds for Dark Noise 1.2:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cat Purring</li>
  <li>Spaceship Engine</li>
  <li>Frogs</li>
  <li>Distant Thunder</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/10/16/new-sounds.png" alt="New Sounds" /></p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>By far the most highly requested feature since launch is the ability to mix multiple sounds together to create your own personal soundscape.  Now that my iOS 13 update is out of the way, this is my top priority.</p>

<p>I’m a slow, deliberate developer and this is not my full time job (currently 😏) so it will take some time to do this right.  I’ve already started <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1170390447660949514?s=20">playing around with the design</a> and I would love to hear any feedback or ideas from you all through <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNoiseApp/">Reddit</a>, or <a href="mailto:dev.charliemchapman@gmail.com">Email</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the app (as well as a spiffy new app video preview) on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">App Store</a> today!</p>

    Marketing Dark Noise
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">27 Sep 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>It’s been 1 month since I released my app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> in the App Store.  The release went <a href="/posts/2019/9/4/dark-noise-week-1">very well</a>, and I’ve had quite a few people ask how I marketed the app.  I wanted to post this right away, but first I wanted to let the launch stats settle down so you can get a better picture of what the actual results are.</p>

<p>Let’s start with some quick 1st month stats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>📈 4,545 Downloads</li>
  <li>💰 $19K Sales</li>
  <li>💵 $12.6K Proceeds (after Apple cut)</li>
  <li>⭐️ 212 ratings with a 4.8 avg</li>
  <li>📝 43 reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m really happy with these numbers, but they definitely don’t paint the entire picture.  Let’s look at a graph of unit sales over the first month.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/27/dark-noise-month-1-unit-sales.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Month 1 Unit Sales" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Metrics from App Store Connect</p>

<p>I think launch week went exceptionally well for a first time developer, but sales have settled down to averaging around the 20-30 downloads a day range.  I’m sharing this to give some context around what the marketing of Dark Noise produced.</p>

<p>Alright, now that the context is out of the way, let’s get to the goods.  Don’t think of this as advice as much as it’s a document detailing everything I did to help market Dark Noise.</p>

<h3 id="private-beta">Private Beta</h3>

<p>Once I had a usable app that could successfully play a few white noise sounds <em>and</em> I was confident enough that I was actually going to release the app, I enrolled in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a> and opened up a private beta through TestFlight.</p>

<p>Initially I targeted a single user, my sister, and made sure it had a sound I knew she listened to at night.  Her first request was for a timer, and almost immediately it was helpful talking to a real person using the app.</p>

<p>Over time I slowly added people to the beta, collecting feedback and bug reports.  It was surprisingly difficult to show people the app at this early rough stage, but I cannot express how valuable it was.</p>

<p>Getting early feedback allowed me to make some design changes before I went too deep in one direction.  Just as importantly, it helped me squash a lot of little embarrassing bugs <strong>before</strong> opening the beta to a wider audience.</p>

<p>There was also a higher level of engagement per user at this stage, since everybody was either a person I knew, or someone who had to explicitly ask for an invite through Twitter.</p>

<h3 id="public-beta">Public Beta</h3>

<p>Once I had the app in a state I felt was worthy to really start showing off, I opened the beta to the public.  I sort of treated this stage like a soft launch of the app.  I had a lot of work I wanted to do, but I treated these users as if they were customers and I created an <a href="https://twitter.com/darknoiseapp">app Twitter account</a> to tweet out updates and respond to user feedback.  I launched the beta on July 9th, so about a month and a half before the actual launch.</p>

<p>Opening the beta to the public early was definitely one of the best decisions I made.  The feedback from users was invaluable, and I built up an excited audience, who was invested in the app by launch.  This really helped build up some pre-launch hype, and I received a lot of reviews and tweets on launch day from people that started with “I’ve been on the beta for a while…”.  I believe this lent an air of credibility that I wouldn’t have had otherwise as a brand new developer.</p>

<p>The last note I’d like to make on the public beta is that I really tried to show beta testers how much I appreciated their help.  I tried to respond to emails quickly, but also conversationally.  If they sent me an idea I didn’t plan on implementing, I tried to explain why.  And when people sent bugs or features I used, I tried to express how thankful I was both in my response, and also by adding a little personalized thank you in the beta release notes.</p>

<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>

<p>Probably the biggest contributing factor to the successful launch of Dark Noise was the excitement I built leading up to the launch through Twitter.</p>

<p>While working a feature I’d usually tweet about the progress and hype up the next beta release if there was something coming.  Frequently people would chime in with feedback or suggestions that I could incorporate immediately.  This both made the app better and also gave those who engaged on Twitter a little slice of ownership in the app.  This is one of those things that only an indie app can pull off, and I think it’s part of what makes people love them so much.</p>

<p>One feature that really blew up was the custom app icons.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/27/charlie-custom-icons-tweet.jpg" alt="Tweet about custom icons" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Open tweet in Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1154771704952098816">here</a></p>

<p>Earlier this year I saw David Smith add a tribute to Myke Hurley in his app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calzones/id1451728473">CalZones</a> by creating a theme called #MykeWasRight (the name of his old Tumblr blog) as a thank you for some help in the early stages of the app. I love Myke’s podcast <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> that he hosts with CGP Grey so I thought it might be fun to add a similar tribute to my app in the form of a custom icon.</p>

<p>This idea really excited me and I ended up running with it and creating a bunch of custom app icons for a lot of tech podcasts I really like.  When I tweeted about it, it seemed to really strike a chord with my fellow Apple tech nerd followers and generated a little buzz, enough so that it even came across the radar of Federico Viticci, Founder and Editor-In-Chief of the incredible <a href="https://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>.  I don’t actually know this for sure, but I suspect that this is what led to Ryan Christoffel finding the app and eventually writing up a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/">review on MacStories</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the lesson here is.  In my case using social media to build up an audience and hype up new features really paid off.  I think attempting to fish for <em>“influencers”</em> attention is something that will almost certainly backfire, but if you’re excited about what you’re making and you talk about it enough in a genuine way, you might eventually get the attention of someone who can really make a difference.</p>

<h3 id="press-kit">Press Kit</h3>

<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say about this.  I made a press kit.  You can check it out <a href="https://darknoise.app/presskit">here</a>.  I don’t know if it’s a good one, or a bad one.  I do know that it was helpful for a few people who ended up writing a day one post about Dark Noise, specifically the screenshots and hero images.</p>

<div style="width: 100%;max-width: 560px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><iframe style="width:100%" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7BDtu9CkAI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>&lt;/iframe&gt;</div>

<p>I also made this little promo video.  To be honest, this was an indulgence for me as I love motion graphics and needed a break one evening.  I didn’t really make it for marketing purposes, but I did end up using it in my “official” announcement tweets for the Dark Noise Twitter account and pinned that tweet.  I’ve gotten a few comments from people that it lends a credibility to the app since it looks pretty professional.</p>

<p>I also <em>should</em> add this to the top of my website, but I still haven’t gotten around to that. 😬</p>

<h3 id="contacting-press">Contacting Press</h3>

<p>I don’t think I did the <em>best</em> job with reaching out to the press, but I did end up getting a few articles written about Dark Noise.  Here’s a quick list of launch articles from both traditional tech websites and some personal tech blogs:</p>

</ul>

<p>One thing I haven’t mentioned yet is that I selected a release date about a month beforehand.  Not only did this help <em>me</em> with forcing myself to stop adding features and drive towards polishing up what I had, but it also allowed me to give the press a hard target for when to expect the app to come out.</p>

<p>Once I had the app in a state I felt wasn’t embarrassing, and I set up my press kit and website, I started contacting the press.  Basically I just went to a bunch of websites I like, and found the emails of writers there that had covered apps before.  I started doing this about 3-4 weeks before releasing that app, but continued pretty much up to launch day as I thought of different publications to reach out to.  I emailed them with a short pitch of the app, a release date, and a link to the press kit.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/27/dark-noise-press-email.jpg" alt="Example email to press" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Here's an example of an email that I sent out to the press.</p>

<p>I received a few “thanks I’ll check it out” responses, but that was basically it.  I believe pretty much all of the press I received on launch day was due to attention and relationships I made during the months of development through Twitter and the public beta.</p>

<p>While writing this article I reached out to a few members of the press and asked them if they had any advice for app developers.  The main takeaway seems to be that you should make your pitch short but clear, and then include relevant information like price, release date, and a link to your press kit with all the assets and images a writer would need to make your app look as good as possible if they do a write-up (specifically high resolution app icon was called out more than once).  This quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/vmarks?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Victor Marks</a> really sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, I need 650 chars to 400 words telling me who it’s for, what it does better, and images and icon to work from with a link to your site and the App Store. Write like we’re friends or you want to be friends, not “professional pr voice”. For the love of god, tell me whose problem you’re solving and why it wasn’t adequately solved before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking back at my emails I don’t think I articulated my sales pitch very well, and that may have contributed to the lack of interest.  Talking to other devs, this seems to be a pretty common outcome, so don’t get discouraged if you never hear anything back.</p>

<h3 id="pre-order">Pre-Order</h3>

<p>About a week before launch day I submitted the app to the App Store and once it was approved, I released it for pre-order.  My thinking was that I would build up a list of day one purchasers which might help boost my ranking in the store.  I’m still not clear on whether pre-orders actually helps your ranking though.</p>

<p>You can also still submit a new version while pre-orders are open, so I actually made a few updates after I released for pre-order and submitted a new version before the real release day.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to note about pre-orders is that they release around midnight in the users local time.  So customers who pre-ordered in New Zealand will have the app released to them the day before everyone in the United States.  For me it was actually kind of fun watching the app make it’s way around the globe through users on Twitter, but it’s something you’ll want to be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="launch-day">Launch Day</h3>

<p>This may sound cheesy, but launch day for Dark Noise is a day I’ll never forget.  It was kind of a whirlwind but so much fun.  I took the day off of work not really sure what to expect, and I’m really glad I did.</p>

<p>First thing in the morning I posted an <a href="/posts/2019/8/27/dark-noise">article on my blog</a> about the release and made announcement posts on Twitter and Facebook.  Once the press coverage started coming in user feedback and questions on Twitter really picked up.  I spent the majority of the day retweeting positive comments and answering questions on Twitter.  I tried to do my best to make it feel like a big splash, so anybody who followed the app account or me would see a lot of activity on that one day.</p>

<p>Aside from responding to people and generally trying to make the launch as noisy as possible, launch day was mostly just watching.  I kept waiting for some embarrassing bug to come up that I’d have to scramble to put a release out for, but it never came.  And since Dark Noise is currently completely offline, I didn’t need to watch over any servers.</p>

<h3 id="podcasts-and-blog-posts">Podcasts and Blog Posts</h3>

<p>Everything I’ve talked about so far has pertained to marketing Dark Noise specifically, but there is actually another piece to this.  Since I’m completely new to the iOS dev scene, I wanted to establish myself with this community.  The bulk of that was done through engagement on Twitter, but I also guested on multiple podcasts and wrote up a few blog posts like this one.</p>

<p>I didn’t really do much active work to get on the podcasts, just <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1156990696047423488?s=20">tweeted</a> out that I was available and accepted basically any invitation I got. 😆 I’m not sure how effective these were at promoting Dark Noise specifically, but I still think it was worth it for the relationships it helped build and (hopefully) helping establish my voice in the community.</p>

<h3 id="odds--ends">Odds &amp; Ends</h3>

<p>I tried out App Store Search Ads, but personally I didn’t find them very effective.  I’m just using the “Basic” ads, so I’m not really doing much work to make them effective, but just want to call that out.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cxvg0c/i_released_a_white_noise_ios_app_this_week_with/">posted to /r/Apple</a> on Reddit which did very well and drove a lot of sales.  They (currently) allow developers to post about new apps on Saturdays, but definitely read their rules before posting.</p>

<p>With regards to feedback, I’ve tried to respond to people as quickly as possible whether through Twitter, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNoiseApp/">Dark Noise subreddit</a>, or email.  I’ve gotten a number of 5 star reviews that specifically call this out, so I think it’s paid off.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>

<p>Hopefully this is helpful for some of you.  I think I’ve captured most of the marketing efforts I made for Dark Noise, but I may update this post if I remember something else.</p>

<p>If you have thoughts on anything I talked about here, or marketing ideas that have worked for your app, please reach out to me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">@_chuckyc</a>.  I love talking about this stuff!</p>

    Week 1 Stats for Dark Noise
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">04 Sep 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Week 1 of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> is in the bag!  Here’s some quick stats of how the week went:</p>

<ul>
  <li>📈 3,192 Downloads</li>
  <li>💰 $13.5K Sales</li>
  <li>💵 $8.99K Proceeds (after Apple cut)</li>
  <li>⭐️ 69 ratings with a 4.86 avg</li>
  <li>📝 24 reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>In ranks Dark Noise peaked at:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2nd in Health &amp; Fitness on iPad</li>
  <li>5th in Health &amp; Fitness on iPhone</li>
  <li>77th in Top Apps</li>
  <li>162nd in Top Overall (includes games)</li>
</ul>

<p>I just wanted to give a brief breakdown of some of the metrics gathered from the first week of Dark Noise being released in the store, and some of my (very amateur) thoughts.  Hopefully if you have an app release incoming, this might be helpful in setting expectations or at the very least be interesting 😅.  This is mostly just me sharing my experience rather than giving advice, so take any theories I have with a heavy grain of salt.</p>

<p class="postCaption">Metrics from App Store Connect</p>

<p>The app launched on August 27th, but notice I have a few sales from the 26th?  That’s because I used Apple’s pre-order feature, which it turns out will release the app around 12:00am the morning of release date in <strong>local time</strong>, presumably based on which regional App Store the pre-order was made from.</p>

<p>Since App Store connect appears to update metrics based on midnight California time, anybody who pre-ordered or downloaded the app right away from east of the US such as New Zealand or the UK, will show up on the 26th.</p>

<p>Anyway, let’s look at the numbers.  Day 1 was easily my biggest sales day.  I believe this was mostly made up from the small community I had built up through the beta testing period and some press I received including a wonderful <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/">review on MacStories</a>. So let’s look at the sources!</p>

<p class="postCaption">Sources for App Store page views that lead to units sold</p>

<p>I think the combination of <strong>App Store Search</strong> and <strong>Web Referer</strong> lines up with people following direct links from reviews and social media, as well as people searching directly for Dark Noise after seeing it somewhere else.</p>

<p>At first, there seemed to be a pretty strong correlation between page views and units sold, but as the week progressed, <em>App Store Browse</em> page views started climbing, but didn’t seem to have much of an impact on sales.  I believed this might be linked to the App Store ranking.  So let’s take a look at the rankings!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/04/dark-noise-week-1-ranking.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Week 1 Ranking" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Week 1 rankings provided by <a href="https://appfigures.com">appfigures</a></p>

<p>I was wrong! Ranking actually seems to be pretty correlated with unit sales instead.  So I have no idea why my <strong>App Store Browse</strong> page views started climbing so much to seemingly no effect 🤷‍♂️.  Dark Noise was just added to the top of the <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1169058911124635648?s=20">Apps We Love Right Now</a> list on the US app store but that was after the week 1 date range we’re looking at here.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about that second spike on Saturday.  That was the day I posted about Dark Noise to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cxvg0c/i_released_a_white_noise_ios_app_this_week_with/">/r/Apple</a> on Reddit.</p>

<p>That subreddit is huge, and they allow app devs to post announcements about their apps on Saturdays.  I read about this a while ago, set a reminder on my phone for the Saturday after I was planning to launch, and promptly forgot about it until my phone reminded me Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The post ended up going to the front page pretty quickly gathering 1,500 upvotes and hundreds of comments which had a pretty clear impact on sales.  If you’ve got an app coming soon, I cannot recommend this enough.  You can see the results right here!</p>

<p>I don’t have much more analysis, but here are some other metrics that you might find interesting.  And as always feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Twitter</a> if you have any questions or metrics you’re interested in seeing.  I like sharing and comparing this data as it really helps me understand the market better, especially as a newcomer.</p>
