    Week 1 Stats for Dark Noise
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">04 Sep 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Week 1 of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> is in the bag!  Here‚Äôs some quick stats of how the week went:</p>

<ul>
  <li>üìà 3,192 Downloads</li>
  <li>üí∞ $13.5K Sales</li>
  <li>üíµ $8.99K Proceeds (after Apple cut)</li>
  <li>‚≠êÔ∏è 69 ratings with a 4.86 avg</li>
  <li>üìù 24 reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>In ranks Dark Noise peaked at:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2nd in Health &amp; Fitness on iPad</li>
  <li>5th in Health &amp; Fitness on iPhone</li>
  <li>77th in Top Apps</li>
  <li>162nd in Top Overall (includes games)</li>
</ul>

<p>I just wanted to give a brief breakdown of some of the metrics gathered from the first week of Dark Noise being released in the store, and some of my (very amateur) thoughts.  Hopefully if you have an app release incoming, this might be helpful in setting expectations or at the very least be interesting üòÖ.  This is mostly just me sharing my experience rather than giving advice, so take any theories I have with a heavy grain of salt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/04/dark-noise-week-1-overview.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Week 1 Overview" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Metrics from App Store Connect</p>

<p>The app launched on August 27th, but notice I have a few sales from the 26th?  That‚Äôs because I used Apple‚Äôs pre-order feature, which it turns out will release the app around 12:00am the morning of release date in <strong>local time</strong>, presumably based on which regional App Store the pre-order was made from.</p>

<p>Since App Store connect appears to update metrics based on midnight California time, anybody who pre-ordered or downloaded the app right away from east of the US such as New Zealand or the UK, will show up on the 26th.</p>

<p>Anyway, let‚Äôs look at the numbers.  Day 1 was easily my biggest sales day.  I believe this was mostly made up from the small community I had built up through the beta testing period and some press I received including a wonderful <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/">review on MacStories</a>. So let‚Äôs look at the sources!</p>

<p class="postCaption">Sources for App Store page views that lead to units sold</p>

<p>I think the combination of <strong>App Store Search</strong> and <strong>Web Referer</strong> lines up with people following direct links from reviews and social media, as well as people searching directly for Dark Noise after seeing it somewhere else.</p>

<p>At first, there seemed to be a pretty strong correlation between page views and units sold, but as the week progressed, <em>App Store Browse</em> page views started climbing, but didn‚Äôt seem to have much of an impact on sales.  I believed this might be linked to the App Store ranking.  So let‚Äôs take a look at the rankings!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/04/dark-noise-week-1-ranking.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Week 1 Ranking" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Week 1 rankings provided by <a href="https://appfigures.com">appfigures</a></p>

<p>I was wrong! Ranking actually seems to be pretty correlated with unit sales instead.  So I have no idea why my <strong>App Store Browse</strong> page views started climbing so much to seemingly no effect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Dark Noise was just added to the top of the <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1169058911124635648?s=20">Apps We Love Right Now</a> list on the US app store but that was after the week 1 date range we‚Äôre looking at here.</p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs talk about that second spike on Saturday.  That was the day I posted about Dark Noise to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cxvg0c/i_released_a_white_noise_ios_app_this_week_with/">/r/Apple</a> on Reddit.</p>

<p>That subreddit is huge, and they allow app devs to post announcements about their apps on Saturdays.  I read about this a while ago, set a reminder on my phone for the Saturday after I was planning to launch, and promptly forgot about it until my phone reminded me Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The post ended up going to the front page pretty quickly gathering 1,500 upvotes and hundreds of comments which had a pretty clear impact on sales.  If you‚Äôve got an app coming soon, I cannot recommend this enough.  You can see the results right here!</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have much more analysis, but here are some other metrics that you might find interesting.  And as always feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Twitter</a> if you have any questions or metrics you‚Äôre interested in seeing.  I like sharing and comparing this data as it really helps me understand the market better, especially as a newcomer.</p>

  <a href="/posts/2019/9/2/designing-dark-noise">
    Designing Dark Noise
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">02 Sep 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Today I want to talk about the process I used for designing my new app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a>.  It‚Äôs an app for playing different ambient noises to help with sleep or focus.  I‚Äôm not a designer by trade, and this is the first app I‚Äôve made for iOS, so this is more of a brain dump of everything I did and less of a proposal on how design should be done.</p>

<p>Before I placed a pixel in any design tool, I first figured out what the guiding principles for the app were, and what features I wanted to include.  I detailed this step in a <a href="/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise">separate post</a>, but the end result was:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Configurability</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Targeting pro users who want as many options and hooks to work the app into their workflow as possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening app to playing sound should be as fast as possible with no compromise since this is the 99% use case</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)
    <ul>
      <li>Most users will probably be using this in a dark environment, possibly without their glasses on or half asleep.  Keep that in mind.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have a little bit of experience playing around with <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>, so I decided to use that to build out my mockups.  I ended up loving XD so I‚Äôd highly recommend it.  It‚Äôs even free! <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="round-1">Round 1</h1>

<p>The first thing I built was a player page based on the 3rd principle: <strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/02/dark-noise-design-v01.jpg" alt="Dark Noise design version 01" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">In case you doubted my lack of design pedigree, this was full design, not a wireframe üòÖ</p>

<p>Once you get passed the blandness, you can pretty much see the bones of the app from the beginning.  An easy to hit play button, a name, and a way to get to the other sounds.</p>

<p>The ‚ÄúCreate Noise‚Äù page was based on my original idea of generating the different color noises on the fly, and building a little color picker style control to let you mix your own noise.  For technical/scope reasons I ended up not going this direction at all, but I do anticipate implementing a ‚ÄúCreate Noise‚Äù feature at some point in the future.</p>

<p>I also had the main swiping gesture for minimizing the player there from the beginning.  One cool thing about Adobe XD is that you can quickly setup prototypes with swiping gestures for animations, and then demo them interactively on the phone.  So I could quickly play around with different ideas and get a sense of how they <em>felt</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-design-prototyping.gif" alt="Dark Noise design version 01" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Recorded on my iPhone previewing the XD prototype. I toyed around with having the player minimize to the top, but the rapid prototyping with XD quickly showed me that didn't feel right</p>

<p>The ‚ÄúCharcoal Dreams‚Äù name has an interesting back story.  From the beginning I knew I wanted to add some sort of fun whimsical feel to the app.  I thought it might be fun to give each noise an obnoxiously whimsical name, and if you 3D touched the name you‚Äôd get a silly description along the lines of ‚Äúearthy notes with a hint of cinnamon‚Äù or something.</p>

<p>Since I switched strategies to using audio recordings, this didn‚Äôt make as much sense, but I didn‚Äôt give up on that goal of having something fun.</p>

<p class="postCaption">First video I could find of a working version of the app.  This was in May, so about 4-5 months in.</p>

<p>This first design wasn‚Äôt pretty, but the structural bones were pretty good.  It gave me a direction to go on as I built out the first version of the app.</p>

<h1 id="round-2">Round 2</h1>

<p>At this stage I actually had a functional app that had a lot of the features I wanted, but it just looked‚Ä¶ bleh.  I am not a designer by trade, so I didn‚Äôt really know what to do to make this look better.  A designer friend at work pointed me to <a href="https://mobbin.design">Mobbin</a>.  It‚Äôs a simple website that allows you to view screenshots of hundreds of different well designed apps, with a pretty good search functionality.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/02/mobbin-screenshot.jpg" alt="Mobbin" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Here I'm searching for "Audio Playback" patterns in apps under the "Music" category on <a href="https://mobbin.design">Mobbin</a></p>

<p>Mobbin helped point me at what elements make up a good looking mobile app, and after iterating on a couple ideas in XD, I landed on a design that will start to look familiar if you‚Äôve used the app.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/09/02/dark-noise-design-v02.jpg" alt="Dark Noise design version 02" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">This should look familiar.</p>

<p>There are two interesting design details I‚Äôd like to call out.</p>

<h4 id="select-noise-arrow">Select Noise Arrow</h4>

<p>I really liked the idea of the initial view you see of the app being a super simple page with a big play button, but that meant I had to hide the other sound options behind the second screen.  I ended up with a slightly unusual design that treated the first page you see as a maximized player that you have to swipe down to reveal the rest of the app.</p>

<p>I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt be immediately clear <em>how</em> you‚Äôre supposed to proceed from that page if you wanted to change your noise, so I borrowed a design element from my first MacBook Pro and gave the down arrow a little ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù animation.  I‚Äôm hoping the gentle bounce and opacity change will draw a new users eye enough to guide them through the app, but also not be an annoying distraction in the future.</p>

<h4 id="icon-animations">Icon Animations</h4>

<p>One thing I really like about some other audio apps is when it‚Äôs visually clear when audio is playing so if your speakers are muted you have an indication that sound <em>should</em> be coming out.  For example, in <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>, a darker tint color bounces on the pause button along with the audio that‚Äôs playing to let you know that there is sound being played.</p>

<p>I came up with a few ideas in After Effects, but I either couldn‚Äôt figure out how to implement it properly, or it just didn‚Äôt feel right once I implemented it into the app.</p>

<div class="postVideoContainer">

    </video>
</div>
<p class="postCaption">A couple play / pause ideas I tried out.</p>

<p>One idea I had pretty early on was to make a looping animation for each of the static noise icons I was already building.  This sounded fun for me, but I was afraid it would take a long time and not really be worth the time it would take me.</p>

<p>At one point I finally decided to try it out and see how it felt.  I made the animation for the White Noise icon and added it to the app, and it just felt awesome.</p>

<p class="postCaption">Some of the icons I created for Dark Noise</p>

<p>This solved my ‚Äúplaying indicator‚Äù problem, but even more importantly I found the <em>fun</em> I was looking for that I could use to stamp the app with my personality.</p>

<h1 id="last-thoughts">Last Thoughts</h1>

<p>There are other small touches throughout the app, but I think this touches on the biggest ones.  Like I said, I‚Äôm not a designer by trade, this is just to outline my thought process while I still remember it.  Hopefully this is helpful to somebody out there.</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Yesterday‚Äôs release of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> exceeded my wildest expectations.  According to my stats from Apple, the app sold <strong>990</strong> copies which brought in <strong>$4,190</strong> in sales for a take home of <strong>$2,780</strong> after Apple‚Äôs 30% cut.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="postCaption">Statistics from App Store Connect</p>

<p>And the reaction from the community has been unbelievable.  Friends and strangers alike have said so many kind words on Twitter, personal blogs, podcasts, and even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsGnnwqbJuU">YouTube video</a>!  And to top that all off, one of my favorite websites, MacStories, wrote up <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/">an amazing review</a>.</p>

<p>A few people have asked me how I got the coverage that I did considering I had essentially zero following and zero connections a few months ago, and my honest <em>feeling</em> is that I didn‚Äôt do anything special and simply got lucky.  But I think that‚Äôs kind of a cop-out answer.</p>

<p>In a recent podcast, Myke Hurley mentioned that he‚Äôs stopped saying he got <strong>‚Äúlucky‚Äù</strong> in achieving the success he‚Äôs had with his company <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> and started using the term <strong>‚Äúfortunate‚Äù</strong> instead.  As usual, I think #MykeWasRight.</p>

<p>The truth is, I did work really hard and tried <em>a lot</em> of different things.  I have no idea what really worked and what didn‚Äôt, but I can at least share what I did and explain my mindset.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to try to write up as much as I can over the next few weeks while this is fresh on my mind, so keep your eyes on this feed if you‚Äôre curious.

    Dark Noise is in the App Store ü•≥
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">27 Aug 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Today I released my first app to the App Store, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a>.  It‚Äôs a simple yet powerful way to play ambient noise to help you sleep, focus, or relax.</p>

<p>This is the part where I‚Äôm supposed to tell you about a brilliant revelation I had that led me to solve a problem you don‚Äôt even know you have.  But I cannot, because that‚Äôs now how all of this went down.</p>

<p>The truth is, Dark Noise started as a simple learning exercise and has turned into something more.  I chose to build an ambient noise app because I‚Äôm very picky, and there wasn‚Äôt one in the store that fit exactly what I wanted: simple, fast, and fun.  There are a lot of options out there, many of them quite good, but I think I‚Äôve landed on a balance of those three attributes that is truly unique.</p>

<h1 id="simple">Simple</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/08/27/dark-noise-simple.png" alt="Player and sound picker screenshots" /></p>

<p>From the beginning, Dark Noise was designed to be simple to use.  I primarily use ambient noise to help me sleep, and I wanted to make something that was really easy to use at night, half-asleep without my glasses on.</p>

<p>The main player page has a simple big play button that stands out in the dark. And a quick swipe down will reveal all of the different noises that can be played with a tap.</p>

<h1 id="fast">Fast</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/08/27/dark-noise-speed.png" alt="Favorites, Siri, and widget screenshots" /></p>

<p>At the end of the day, an ambient noise app‚Äôs job is to start a sound, and then get out of the way as fast as possible, so I designed Dark Noise to have multiple ways to quickly start your favorite sound.</p>

<p>You can add and reorder your favorite sounds to a section that always shows at the top of the selection page.  Siri Shortcuts integrations allows you to create a shortcut to start any specific sound using only your voice, even through a HomePod!  And a customizable widget and Home screen quick actions allow you to quickly activate a noise before opening the app.</p>

<h1 id="fun">Fun</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2019/08/27/dark-noise-themes.png" alt="Dark Noise themes" /></p>

<p>Something I learned from the wonderful weather app <a href="https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/">Carrot</a> is that a utility app can be delightful to use.  I wanted to try to make Dark Noise something that is fun to open up and interact with.</p>

<p>I loaded it up with multiple themes, and (way to many) custom app icon options, but the thing that I‚Äôm really proud of is all of the custom animations.  Each noise has a custom icon that comes to life when you start playing it.  And the buttons throughout the UI have little animations peppered throughout to make the app fun and fluid to navigate.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm really proud of how Dark Noise came together, but it wouldn‚Äôt be close to what it is today without all of the help I‚Äôve received along the way.  First from my friends at work who‚Äôve essentially let me leech Swifty wisdom from them over the last 8 months.  And also from the iOS developer / enthusiast community.  Over 900 people have joined the beta and provided me with countless bug reports, feature ideas, and marketing advice.  I can‚Äôt express enough how helpful this has been and it‚Äôs inspired me to try to lift others up more than I do.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning and I‚Äôm excited to see where Dark Noise goes from here.  As always, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkNoiseApp">Twitter</a> or on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNoiseApp/">Dark Noise Subreddit</a></p>

    The Principles of Dark Noise
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">23 Aug 2019</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>At the beginning of this year I started working on my first indie app to release in the App Store called <a href="https://darknoise.app">Dark Noise</a>.  It‚Äôs an ambient noise app for iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p>At first, I had a giant list of feature ideas and no idea how to distill them into a focused product. So I started by forcing myself to pick 3 principles to guide the design.</p>

<p>I eventually landed on these core principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Configurability</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Targeting pro users who want as many options and hooks to work the app into their workflow as possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening app to playing sound should be as fast as possible with no compromise since this is the 99% use case</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)
    <ul>
      <li>Most users will probably be using this in a dark environment, possibly without their glasses on or half asleep.  Keep that in mind.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After creating the principles, I took my list of feature ideas and tried to slot them all into one of those principles.  If they didn‚Äôt fit, I tossed them in the backlog.</p>

<p>Keeping these principles in mind as I tried to design and form an MVP was really helpful.  I have a tendency to get overly excited by an idea and drop whatever I‚Äôm doing and build it.  Often that‚Äôs a bad idea, but sometimes it‚Äôs good!</p>

<p>Whenever I had the thought of adding a bunch of custom app icons referencing podcasts I like, I realized it was something that might actually resonate with the pro users I was targeting.  And seems to have done just that!</p>

<p>This also played into my pricing decisions as that market tends to prefer paying up front and is a little more averse to ads.  That‚Äôs not to say I won‚Äôt add a free tier in the future (in fact I probably will) but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm always keeping in mind as I make these decisions.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm not an expert at this, heck I‚Äôm barely a beginner, but maybe you‚Äôll find my thought process interesting nonetheless.</p>
