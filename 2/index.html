    First Sale
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">01 Jan 2021</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> has been in the App Store for over a year, yet I‚Äôve never actually run a sale before. In fact, the only price change I‚Äôve made at all is increasing the price by a few dollars when I shipped my 2.0 update.</p>

<p>This was due partially to laziness, but also a slight sense of feeling gross about sales for some reason? Truth be told I don‚Äôt have a good reason for this, but I had this generic (and quite frankly silly) notion in the back of my mind that it feels slightly desperate and devalues the product somehow.</p>

<p>So when <a href="https://twitter.com/frboulais?s=21">Fran√ßois</a> reached out about joining his <a href="https://twitter.com/indieappsanta">Indie App Santa</a> project and putting Dark Noise on sale for 50% for 1 day I was weirdly hesitant. But I figured ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù and agreed.</p>

<p>Based on literally no data I kinda figured that I‚Äôd probably get around double the sales from the Indie App Santa Twitter account promotion and me tweeting about it from my account. At 50% off this would mean I‚Äôd pretty much be breaking even on revenue. Since Dark Noise is paid up front with no subscription or in app purchases, this would basically be a wash with a <em>slight</em> bump in users.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my sales for the month of december. See if you can spot what day the sale took place! üòÖ</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg" alt="Dark Noise December Sales" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Note: This is sales, not units so the 50% off is already taken into account.</p>

<p>This was a <strong>way</strong> bigger bump than I was expecting, easily making up for the price difference. It‚Äôs worth noting it did trail off pretty quickly after the sale ended. It‚Äôs a bit hard to tell exactly how quickly because sales bumped again a few days later on Christmas when the app was mentioned in a few ‚ÄúBest apps for your new phone‚Äù articles.</p>

<p>One thing I‚Äôm curious about is what‚Äôs driving the sales spike. Indie App Santa has almost 5,000 followers on Twitter who are actively looking for app deals, so I‚Äôm curious how much is driven by them and how much is the sale itself.</p>

<p>Lets look at the <strong>Sources</strong> data provided by App Store Connect.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Sales Sources" /></p>

<p>As expected Web Referrers and App Store Search have big spikes, but curiously so is App Store Browse (customers who found the app through general App Store browsing vs direct link or specifically searching my app). Possibly this is because the price is lower so more people who saw the app converted to sales? My conversion rate for the day was up 59.3% (though still very low) but there‚Äôs so much noise from all the direct sales that this is hard to really tease out what‚Äôs really going on here.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dig into where the web referrers are coming from.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Web Referrers" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">The actual numbers here are much lower than the numbers on the aggregated "Sources" page in App Store Connect. Not sure what to make of that?</p>

<p>‚Äút.co‚Äù is traffic coming from Twitter (I think that‚Äôs something to do with their url shortener or analytics or something?) so that definitely lines up with what I was expecting. And most other referrers are probably from people doing some research on the app through my website or reviews written about it after they saw the app on sale on Twitter. Somebody also made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppHookup/comments/khyrg6/iosdark_noise599_299/">Reddit post</a> on a subreddit that promotes app sales that drove some sales as well.</p>

<p>App Referrers also has a few interesting tidbits.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-app-referrers.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Web Referrers" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Here again actual numbers are lower than the aggregated "Sources" page.</p>

<p>The excellent app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/scriptable/id1405459188">Scriptable</a> at the top is, I believe, a result of their <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptableapp/status/1334849125544841216">partnership with Indie App Santa</a> where you could make a widget for what app is on sale each day using Scriptable. Tweetbot and Reddit apps make sense for the same reasons as the web traffic (I believe the official Twitter app will always show through Web Referrers because it routes you through Safari when you click links?).</p>

<p>The interesting bit here is that there appears to be some apps out there still that track apps with price drops that can drive at least a some sales. I‚Äôll have to experiment at some point by lowering the price with zero promotion and see how that impacts sales for the day.</p>

<p>Overall I think this experience shows me I should definitely be experimenting with pricing and sales more (duh!). I think I still want to keep them relatively infrequent for now, but in 2021 I think I‚Äôll probably do some more experiments to see what I can do when promoting them on my own.</p>

<p class="post-meta">17 Sep 2020</p>

<div class="post-content">

<h2 id="other-features">Other features</h2>

<p>Along with the new widgets there are numerous enhancements included in Dark Noise 2.1</p>

<p>Today I‚Äôm finally releasing the biggest update of Dark Noise to date to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">App Store</a>! Dark Noise 2 is the next major evolution of the best ambient noise app on iOS. Mixing sounds has been the most requested feature since launch and I‚Äôm excited to announce it‚Äôs finally here! A lot of work went in to maintaining the simplicity and tight iOS integration Dark Noise is known for and I‚Äôm very proud of the results. Along with iCloud syncing, new sounds, new icons, and loads of bug fixes this is the biggest update to date.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/07/20/create-mix-examples.PNG" alt="Create Mix Examples" /></p>

<p><strong>Create Mix</strong> ‚Ä¢ Build your own custom mix from any number of sounds. Mix multiple of the same sound for even more variety! Animated icons can be built using the new icon creator or images or animated GIFs can be imported from the Photo Library.</p>

<p><strong>iCloud Syncing</strong> ‚Ä¢ Custom mixes and favorites will now sync to all of your devices using iCloud! No need to sign in or configure anything, your data will simply follow you to all of your Apple devices.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/07/20/dark-noise-2-new-sounds.PNG" alt="New Sounds" /></p>

<p><strong>8 New Sounds</strong> ‚Ä¢ New sounds have been added to the Dark Noise catalogue for playing on their own or added to mixes including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rain on Tent</li>
  <li>Wind Chimes</li>
  <li>Windy Trees</li>
  <li>Seagulls</li>
  <li>Lake</li>
  <li>Ship Deck</li>
  <li>Flag</li>
  <li>Lullaby</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>iPad Pointer Support</strong> ‚Ä¢ Navigate Dark Noise 2 using a trackpad or mouse with full pointer support on the iPad.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/07/20/dark-noise-2-new-icons.png" alt="New Icons" /></p>

<p><strong>New Icons</strong> ‚Ä¢ Inspired by the new design of macOS Big Sur a skeuomorphic icon was added to the list of custom icons. And the new Launched icon is in honor of <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">my new(ish) podcast of the same name</a>.</p>

<p><strong>And More!</strong> ‚Ä¢ Bug fixes, improved shortcuts support, and a rewritten audio engine, and even a new ‚ÄúAuto Volume‚Äù experimental feature round out the biggest update yet.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs Next</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs still so much more I have planned for the future of Dark Noise. First is getting ready for iOS 14. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1284552561278832645">early tests</a> with the new Widgets look really promising, and improvements to Siri and Shortcuts look to unlock even more automation possibilities. After that I want to expand on the customization abilities I‚Äôve added with the create mix feature.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for all of your support and kind words over the last year. I‚Äôm so excited to see where Dark Noise can go in the future!</p>

<p>Dark Noise 2 is available on for iPhone and iPad on the App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">here</a>.</p>

    Tutorial: Creating Sketch Style App Icons with Procreate on iPad

</div>

<p>For each episode of <a href="https://launchedfm.com">Launched</a> I create a custom version of the podcast artwork where I replace the paper airplane with a ‚Äúsketchified‚Äù version of the guests app icon (or something else representing the guest if they aren‚Äôt an app dev or can‚Äôt give me permission to use their icon).</p>

<p>This has eventually led to a few developers adding that icon into their app as an optional custom app icon, which delights me to no end ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1255872065711804416?s=21">tweeted as much</a> and there was a lot of questions asking how I make them.  It‚Äôs pretty straight forward so I made a little tutorial showing how I make these sketch style app icons using Procreate on my iPad Pro.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also created 2 files that I use when creating these icons that you can download here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://charliemchapman.com/launched-icon-template/launched-icon-template-background.png">launched-icon-template-background.png</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As always, feedback is appreciated. If I said anything dumb (likely) or if you end up using this technique for a project yourself I‚Äôd love to hear about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/">Twitter</a>!</p>

    Launching Launched
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">27 Jan 2020</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>After launching my new podcast <a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2020/1/13/introducing-launched/">Launched</a> last week, I‚Äôd like to share basically everything I did to design, structure, and plan the launch of the podcast. This will probably be overly long so, uh, buckle up.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not pretending to be an expert at this. I just want to share everything I tried with the hope that it may help others in the future (and so I don‚Äôt forget üòÖ). Check out my previous post outlining the <a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2020/1/21/launching-launched/">week 1 stats</a> to get a sense of what kind of results I ended up achieving with my approach.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also not going to be talking about the technical aspects of recording a podcast. The purpose of this post is to talk about designing and launching the podcast, but I <em>would</em> really like to write about my recording set up and editing workflow at some point. If that sounds interesting to you let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">on Twitter</a> and I may bump that up on my priority list.</p>

<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs start at the beginning. Last year while building my first app <a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2019/8/27/dark-noise/">Dark Noise</a> I ran across a series of interviews that <a href="https://twitter.com/heidi_helen">Heidi Helen Pilypas</a> did after launching her app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/when-did-i/id1463692593?ls=1">When Did I?</a> that I found extremely useful in preparing my own launch.</p>

<p>A few months later, this four Tweet thread pretty much kicked off the show in my mind.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/27/launched-beginning-tweet-thread.jpg" alt="Launched Beginning Tweet Thread" /></p>

<p>The idea of an interview show that could feed off of the constant stream of interesting new apps coming out was really intriguing. I wanted this to exist, and I thought I might be able to actually pull it off.</p>

<h3 id="why-tho">Why tho?</h3>

<p>Any project that‚Äôs going to require a significant investment of your time deserves to have this question answered: Why? For me, there is one ‚Äúaltruistic‚Äù answer and two selfish ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I want this to exist and genuinely think other devs and creators would find it beneficial.</li>
  <li>I think it could help me raise my profile in the community which would help with future app launches and all the nice benefits of having a strong network.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôd get to meet and talk to a bunch of interesting people who‚Äôs work I really respect.</li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding is that the vast majority of podcasts fail to reach a substantial audience, so 1 and 2 may never happen.  But 3 is a benefit I get either way, so in the end I felt it was worth giving it a shot.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-name">Choosing a Name</h3>

<p>Naming is hard. I think this is a truism in basically every discipline (except Sony game consoles üòâ).</p>

<p>For this show, I wanted a very simple word that conveyed the idea releasing an app. I knew early on that I didn‚Äôt want it restricted to only app developers, so I wanted to keep it a little more vague while still conveying that idea. Here‚Äôs my note with the names I was considering:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/27/launched-name-ideas.jpg" alt="Launched Name Ideas" /></p>

<p><strong>Launched</strong> fulfilled all of my checkboxes. It was one word, vague enough to allow for interviews with people in all sorts of industries and disciplines, and it wasn‚Äôt already taken in Apple Podcasts (though ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù was). It also just sounded <em>cool</em>.</p>

<h3 id="logo">Logo</h3>

<p>Once I had a name, I needed a logo. I think the logo for a podcast is actually really important. It‚Äôs basically your one shot at convincing someone to try out the show, and it‚Äôs your only real visual connection you get to make with most of your audience once they subscribe. It also gives me something tangible to hold on to while developing the project that makes everything feel more real.</p>

<p>A name like launched immediately conjured up images of rockets but I felt like that wouldn‚Äôt stand out as much as there are a lot of space podcasts with rocket logos that seem to overlap audience with the technology category. I also toyed with the idea of a shipping container but couldn‚Äôt find something I liked.</p>

<p>I landed on the idea of a paper airplane. I liked the idea of it being a smaller, handcrafted item as I knew most of my guests (and audience) would be indies. And while there are a million email apps that use a paper airplane icon, I didn‚Äôt see any other podcasts using it as their icon.</p>

<p>I started by sketching some ideas in the wonderful <a href="https://linea-app.com/sketch">Linea Sketch</a> app by The Iconfactory.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/27/launched-sketches.jpg" alt="Icon Sketches" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Early artwork concept sketches made in Linea Sketch.</p>

<p>After asking for feedback on Twitter I got an unexpectedly strong positive reaction to the ‚Äúsketch‚Äù look. I was originally thinking of going with a cleaner style, but I thought a rougher look would actually fit with the theme of the show being about people creating something new.</p>

<p>I also really liked encasing the icon in the <a href="https://applypixels.com/blog/the-hunt-for-the-squircle">iOS squircle</a>. I knew I was going to want to make custom artwork for each episode (we‚Äôll get to that later) so I figured this would give me an easy spot to place custom assets.</p>

<p>I wanted a strong color rather than black and white sketches, so I started playing around with a blueprint look. This would still fit the rough sketch style but also give me a strong pop of color to hopefully stand out in podcast apps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/01/27/launched-icon-drafts.jpg" alt="Icon Drafts" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Different variations I tried of the paper airplane artwork design.</p>

<p>I ended up going with the simple clean outline with various sketch marks on it (top right). I don‚Äôt really have a good reason other than it <em>felt</em> the nicest.</p>

<h4 id="custom-episode-artwork">Custom Episode Artwork</h4>

<p>I love shows that make custom artwork for each episode so I wanted to do the same for Launched, but I knew I‚Äôd need to come up with a system that allowed me build them quickly. If it was cumbersome to make, I knew I‚Äôd be angry at myself in 4-6 months when the novelty of the show had worn off and it started getting overwhelming.</p>

<p class="postCaption">Some of the custom icons I created for Launched episodes. The "Beta" artwork is used for the draft episodes I send to guests to let them listen and ask for edits if they want. The glass of ice is used for the "Ice Breaker" chapter in each episode.</p>

<p>The iOS icon provides a nice frame that I can swap in a hand drawn style of an app icon or symbol that represents the guest of that week. It‚Äôs also extremely fast for me to create these using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/ipad.html">Photoshop</a> on my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. I can just duplicated my existing Photoshop psd file, grab an image of the icon from the internet, and trace over it with the pencil.</p>

<p class="postCaption">Timelapse of my process creating the custom artwork for each episode using Photoshop for iPad.</p>

<p>It only takes a few minutes to put most of them together and I think the style looks really interesting and fits the whole theme of the show. It also <em>could</em> make for an interesting custom app icon if any developers that I interview wanted to sneak it in their app. üòâ</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It‚Äôs important to point out that I‚Äôm asking everyone if it‚Äôs ok to use their logo. Most people have been fine with this, but there are cases where people aren‚Äôt comfortable or even legally can‚Äôt for trademark reasons so keep that in mind if you ever want to try something similar.</p>

<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>

<p>With a name and logo out of the way, I was ready to start putting together the structure of the show. Starting at the highest level, I needed to pick a schedule. While I might be able to sustain weekly for a short amount of time, the complexity of scheduling new guests in different timezones every episode is too much for me to attempt weekly. So I landed on a <strong>target</strong> of every other week.</p>

<p><strong>Side Note:</strong> The app <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2019/04/17/introducing-calzones-a-timezone-savvy-calendar/">CalZones</a> by David Smith has proven to be extremely useful scheduling all of these interviews across many different timezones. I‚Äôve also been told <a href="https://calendly.com">Calendly</a> is very good for this as well but I have not tried it yet.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt actually listen to a lot of interview shows so I wasn‚Äôt sure what the best approach would be to structure the episodes themselves. I knew that I wanted them to be conversational in tone but I wasn‚Äôt sure how to keep things from feeling too <em>stiff</em> since most of the time I would be speaking to people for the first time.</p>

<p>I happened to be chewing on this problem while listening to an episode of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade</a> where they start each show by asking one of the hosts, Jason Snell, a random question given by the audience. They‚Äôre often off the wall questions like ‚ÄúWhen putting in AirPods which ear do you put in first?‚Äù This often leads to a funny conversation that get‚Äôs the episode going with a fun energetic vibe.</p>

<p>I decided to co-opt that idea as an ice breaker question and so far (5 episodes in) I feel like it‚Äôs succeeded in building a little rapport with the guests before getting into the episode.</p>

<p>The bulk of the episode is outlined on a per episode basis using research on the particular guest and letting the natural flow of the conversation guide me from section to section.</p>

<p>At the end I‚Äôm asking each guest for a person who‚Äôs been an inspiration for them that they want to shout out and recommend others follow. This serves two purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I want to use this podcast as a way to elevate people making cool things and this is a way to add to that.</li>
  <li>I selfishly want to find more cool people to follow and potentially try to get on the show. üòè</li>
</ol>

<p>So this leaves the general show template like so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Intro</li>
  <li>Ice Breaker</li>
  <li>Guest specific stuff</li>
  <li>Guest‚Äôs inspiration</li>
  <li>Where to find guest (Twitter/website/ect)</li>
  <li>Outro</li>
</ol>

<p>It‚Äôll be interesting to see how this changes over time, but so far I‚Äôve been happy with the balance of structure and loose conversation.</p>

<h3 id="the-launch">The Launch</h3>

<p>My understanding with podcasting is that consistent output is the best way to grow an audience. If you don‚Äôt have a big pre-existing following (which I did not) launch day is not really that important. Despite this, I figured I‚Äôd try to come up with something to make as big as a splash as I could at launch hoping this would help boost numbers which would make it easier to occasionally book bigger guests, which in turn would help boost numbers‚Ä¶ ect. ect.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a motion designer named <a href="https://twitter.com/jkorenman">Joey Korenman</a> started a series of After Effects tutorials called <a href="https://www.schoolofmotion.com/collection/30-days-of-after-effects">30 Days of After Effects</a> where he posted a brand new After Effects tutorial every day for 30 days straight. Tutorials are really difficult to put together so this wasn‚Äôt something that I had ever seen before and it‚Äôs always stuck with me how quickly that intense burst of output catapulted his brand, <a href="https://www.schoolofmotion.com">School of Motion</a>, into the limelight.</p>

<p>I decided to try a similar approach with Launched but at a smaller scale. Not only was 30 episodes in a row way more work than I could manage, but I don‚Äôt think most people would actually want 30 episodes clogging up their podcast queue that quickly. So I settled on 1 business week of 1 episode a day to kick off the show. This would hopefully generate some buzz as well as give listeners multiple episodes to hear in a row to decide if they liked the show, rather than one and done.</p>

<p>On the advice of <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcassinelli/status/1199107531311726593?s=21">Matthew Cassinelli</a> I also created a short teaser episode and released it a month before launching the show. This ensured the podcast was properly set up in all of the major podcast directories and players, and also gave me a small list of subscribers who would get the first episode immediately after release.</p>

<p>I also Tweeted a lot about the journey leading up to the launch of the show as has apparently become my <em>thing</em>. üòÖ This may not be broadly applicable advice but I do think it helped build up a sense of excitement around the launch, and helped make more people invested in its success.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm really happy with how the launch of the show turned out.  I‚Äôm proud of the episodes released so far and I‚Äôm so excited to keep making more and develop the show over time.  Hopeful this post was helpful or at least interesting for you.
