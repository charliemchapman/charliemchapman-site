    First Sale
  </a>
</h1>
<p class="post-meta">01 Jan 2021</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> has been in the App Store for over a year, yet I‚Äôve never actually run a sale before. In fact, the only price change I‚Äôve made at all is increasing the price by a few dollars when I shipped my 2.0 update.</p>

<p>This was due partially to laziness, but also a slight sense of feeling gross about sales for some reason? Truth be told I don‚Äôt have a good reason for this, but I had this generic (and quite frankly silly) notion in the back of my mind that it feels slightly desperate and devalues the product somehow.</p>

<p>So when <a href="https://twitter.com/frboulais?s=21">Fran√ßois</a> reached out about joining his <a href="https://twitter.com/indieappsanta">Indie App Santa</a> project and putting Dark Noise on sale for 50% for 1 day I was weirdly hesitant. But I figured ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù and agreed.</p>

<p>Based on literally no data I kinda figured that I‚Äôd probably get around double the sales from the Indie App Santa Twitter account promotion and me tweeting about it from my account. At 50% off this would mean I‚Äôd pretty much be breaking even on revenue. Since Dark Noise is paid up front with no subscription or in app purchases, this would basically be a wash with a <em>slight</em> bump in users.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my sales for the month of december. See if you can spot what day the sale took place! üòÖ</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg" alt="Dark Noise December Sales" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Note: This is sales, not units so the 50% off is already taken into account.</p>

<p>This was a <strong>way</strong> bigger bump than I was expecting, easily making up for the price difference. It‚Äôs worth noting it did trail off pretty quickly after the sale ended. It‚Äôs a bit hard to tell exactly how quickly because sales bumped again a few days later on Christmas when the app was mentioned in a few ‚ÄúBest apps for your new phone‚Äù articles.</p>

<p>One thing I‚Äôm curious about is what‚Äôs driving the sales spike. Indie App Santa has almost 5,000 followers on Twitter who are actively looking for app deals, so I‚Äôm curious how much is driven by them and how much is the sale itself.</p>

<p>Lets look at the <strong>Sources</strong> data provided by App Store Connect.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Sales Sources" /></p>

<p>As expected Web Referrers and App Store Search have big spikes, but curiously so is App Store Browse (customers who found the app through general App Store browsing vs direct link or specifically searching my app). Possibly this is because the price is lower so more people who saw the app converted to sales? My conversion rate for the day was up 59.3% (though still very low) but there‚Äôs so much noise from all the direct sales that this is hard to really tease out what‚Äôs really going on here.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dig into where the web referrers are coming from.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Web Referrers" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">The actual numbers here are much lower than the numbers on the aggregated "Sources" page in App Store Connect. Not sure what to make of that?</p>

<p>‚Äút.co‚Äù is traffic coming from Twitter (I think that‚Äôs something to do with their url shortener or analytics or something?) so that definitely lines up with what I was expecting. And most other referrers are probably from people doing some research on the app through my website or reviews written about it after they saw the app on sale on Twitter. Somebody also made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppHookup/comments/khyrg6/iosdark_noise599_299/">Reddit post</a> on a subreddit that promotes app sales that drove some sales as well.</p>

<p>App Referrers also has a few interesting tidbits.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2021/01/01/dark-noise-dec-app-referrers.jpg" alt="Dark Noise Web Referrers" /></p>
<p class="postCaption">Here again actual numbers are lower than the aggregated "Sources" page.</p>

<p>The excellent app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/scriptable/id1405459188">Scriptable</a> at the top is, I believe, a result of their <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptableapp/status/1334849125544841216">partnership with Indie App Santa</a> where you could make a widget for what app is on sale each day using Scriptable. Tweetbot and Reddit apps make sense for the same reasons as the web traffic (I believe the official Twitter app will always show through Web Referrers because it routes you through Safari when you click links?).</p>

<p>The interesting bit here is that there appears to be some apps out there still that track apps with price drops that can drive at least a some sales. I‚Äôll have to experiment at some point by lowering the price with zero promotion and see how that impacts sales for the day.</p>

<p>Overall I think this experience shows me I should definitely be experimenting with pricing and sales more (duh!). I think I still want to keep them relatively infrequent for now, but in 2021 I think I‚Äôll probably do some more experiments to see what I can do when promoting them on my own.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other features</h2>

<p>Along with the new widgets there are numerous enhancements included in Dark Noise 2.1</p>

<p>Today I‚Äôm finally releasing the biggest update of Dark Noise to date to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">App Store</a>! Dark Noise 2 is the next major evolution of the best ambient noise app on iOS. Mixing sounds has been the most requested feature since launch and I‚Äôm excited to announce it‚Äôs finally here! A lot of work went in to maintaining the simplicity and tight iOS integration Dark Noise is known for and I‚Äôm very proud of the results. Along with iCloud syncing, new sounds, new icons, and loads of bug fixes this is the biggest update to date.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/07/20/create-mix-examples.PNG" alt="Create Mix Examples" /></p>

<p><strong>Create Mix</strong> ‚Ä¢ Build your own custom mix from any number of sounds. Mix multiple of the same sound for even more variety! Animated icons can be built using the new icon creator or images or animated GIFs can be imported from the Photo Library.</p>

<p><strong>iCloud Syncing</strong> ‚Ä¢ Custom mixes and favorites will now sync to all of your devices using iCloud! No need to sign in or configure anything, your data will simply follow you to all of your Apple devices.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/07/20/dark-noise-2-new-sounds.PNG" alt="New Sounds" /></p>

<p><strong>8 New Sounds</strong> ‚Ä¢ New sounds have been added to the Dark Noise catalogue for playing on their own or added to mixes including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rain on Tent</li>
  <li>Wind Chimes</li>
  <li>Windy Trees</li>
  <li>Seagulls</li>
  <li>Lake</li>
  <li>Ship Deck</li>
  <li>Flag</li>
  <li>Lullaby</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>iPad Pointer Support</strong> ‚Ä¢ Navigate Dark Noise 2 using a trackpad or mouse with full pointer support on the iPad.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020/07/20/dark-noise-2-new-icons.png" alt="New Icons" /></p>

<p><strong>New Icons</strong> ‚Ä¢ Inspired by the new design of macOS Big Sur a skeuomorphic icon was added to the list of custom icons. And the new Launched icon is in honor of <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">my new(ish) podcast of the same name</a>.</p>

<p><strong>And More!</strong> ‚Ä¢ Bug fixes, improved shortcuts support, and a rewritten audio engine, and even a new ‚ÄúAuto Volume‚Äù experimental feature round out the biggest update yet.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs Next</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs still so much more I have planned for the future of Dark Noise. First is getting ready for iOS 14. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1284552561278832645">early tests</a> with the new Widgets look really promising, and improvements to Siri and Shortcuts look to unlock even more automation possibilities. After that I want to expand on the customization abilities I‚Äôve added with the create mix feature.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for all of your support and kind words over the last year. I‚Äôm so excited to see where Dark Noise can go in the future!</p>

<p>Dark Noise 2 is available on for iPhone and iPad on the App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">here</a>.</p>

<p>This year one of my goals was to try to get into confrence speaking. That‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt exactly working out thanks to our good friend COVID-19. But I was given the opportunity to do a quick talk for a remote <a href="https://www.nscoder-chicago.com">NSCoder Chicago</a> meetup and I talked about an experiment I‚Äôve been doing using  UIInterpolatingMotionEffect to create some parallax effects in UIKit.

    Tutorial: Creating Sketch Style App Icons with Procreate on iPad

</div>

<p>For each episode of <a href="https://launchedfm.com">Launched</a> I create a custom version of the podcast artwork where I replace the paper airplane with a ‚Äúsketchified‚Äù version of the guests app icon (or something else representing the guest if they aren‚Äôt an app dev or can‚Äôt give me permission to use their icon).</p>

<p>This has eventually led to a few developers adding that icon into their app as an optional custom app icon, which delights me to no end ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1255872065711804416?s=21">tweeted as much</a> and there was a lot of questions asking how I make them.  It‚Äôs pretty straight forward so I made a little tutorial showing how I make these sketch style app icons using Procreate on my iPad Pro.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also created 2 files that I use when creating these icons that you can download here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/posts/2020/05/01/launched-icon-template-background.png">launched-icon-template-background.png</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/posts/2020/05/01/launched-icon-template-mask.png">launched-icon-template-mask.png</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, feedback is appreciated. If I said anything dumb (likely) or if you end up using this technique for a project yourself I‚Äôd love to hear about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/">Twitter</a>!</p>
